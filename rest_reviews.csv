"I went there for a family dinner . Had the set menu with BBQ chicken and naan, and believe me when I tell you I was utterly disgusted to my core as I've never had BBQ chicken or rather any food in any restaurant that bad. The chicken was bland as hell, tasted like a boiled piece of rubber and almost smelled bad . I don't know if they were having a bad day or something, but the most painful thing was it took them more than 1:30 hours to serve that 'Horror in a plate' .My parents had other set menu items which also included BBQ chicken that tasted almost as bad as mine. Though the staff behavior was good it doesn't make up for the bad food and the long wait. I don't know if my experience was an accident on their part or not but it sure was horrific .",1.0,

"Great decoration, good service but when it comes to food it could be a lot better. Took the Jamaican chicken. It was a little too sweet for me. I took rice as a side and it was burned. When confronted they replied that it was supposed to have a smoky flavor!!!! I don't know what they meant!!! Anyways the chicken was well cooked, the Mocha according to my friend was also good. Rice was regular vegetable fried rice, nothing special. I have had better fried rice at street carts.... Seemed pretty expensive compared to the quality of food they serve. Good place to hangout with friends and family though. Cheers!!! ***Went their a week or two ago.",3.0,

Food very nice. They must concentrate more on their service during bit rush hours in areas like: 1. Serving glass when guests come. I had to call the waiter many times for water glasses. Upon calling they did their job. 2. Green salad portion can be increased a bit in quatity as per price.... 3. For a birthday celebration as booked earlier they should have arranged a small cake. All in all its good. Above points are just some personal comments.,4.0,

Well it is indeed one of my favourite restaurants in Dhaka because of the super tasty chicken and mushroom cream soup. But if I mention about the valentine platter particularly it was not really up to the mark! As it it suppose to be for two people but the rice given is not really enough for two people. Then there's this unnecessary � shaped sandwich! But yes if you talk about the chickens & the pricing comparing to other chicken platters then it was good to go!,4.0,

While I was waiting for my guest after reserving the seats, they asked me rudely as if my guest are coming or not they have other reservation (have to mention that only half an hour passed after I took the seats and half the reserved seats are filled already!!!). After challenging them why they didn't take my reservation earlier when I called, they started... to say they wanted the seats because some ppl just came and ask for seat (I don't see those reservation ppl coming at all that night)....in between the conservation, one waiter said they did 30k per day business as if I give a damn shit about it (30k per day!!! seriously!!! as a brand like yours.......com'on man so poor!!!). After ordering the starter and 1st round of order, they seemed surprised to ask us that 5 person and only 4 dishes!!! REALLY THIS IS THE WAY YOU BEHAVE WITH YOUR CUSTOMERS!!! If someone order food cost 200tk or 20000tk, both are your customers. You should give your staff proper lesson on manners then let them serve for your brand because its degrading the brand value.",1.0,
"I've been to bbq in gulshan 2 numerous times and on each occasion I've been thoroughly pleased. The atmosphere is nice, waiters friendly, tables clean and food delicious.

Whether you've been to bbq already or it would be your first time, you won't be disappointed with those 2 items.",5.0,

"Today we had the most awful experience at BbQ Dhanmondi branch. They have been offering the 50% discount on beverage and i liked their frappe everytime so went their tonight as it was the last night. And even though we had called at their number and verified that the store was open they denied to serve us the frappes! Not ony that, after providing us the menue the waiter was taking a while to come back. I found that the waiter and the manager was solving a dispute with ano...ther client. So called another younger waiter who was walking towards the table then the other waiter made him stop. He literally stoped him coming towards us and then he took another 5mins to solve the dispute.then this waiter and the manager had another chat, more like whispered in the years then they both came to tell they cannot serve the Frappe!!! They said they ran out of all ingredients! They literally didn't want to make the drinks as it was close to the closing time. They has an offer going on and it cannot be that they ran out of every single ingredients of all the drinks!! Even though we had said we didn't want anything else at all that being an International Chain they should be serving us they denied us completely!! I should also mention we went to the Dhanmondi branch just this friday night and the pizza was terrible too!!! It was nothing like the Gulshan branch pizza. Really really disappointed by this ignorant attitude and i doubt i will ever go back.",1.0,

"Okay, here's an honest review. Went to the Dhanmondi Branch yesterday and the food was okay. It was nothing completely out of the ordinary and that would have been completely alright had the items not been priced premium. The service was absolutely horrible! I mean how are you guys still in business with the current lot of waiters? A waiter literally tried to force an item on us by repeatedly insisting in the rudest of manners and the most annoyed of expressions. We had to ca...ll the waiters multiple times before any of them responded, every time. No, they weren't busy, just standing at the nearest tissues counter (or something) doing absolutely nothing. It took them about 15 minutes to get the bill and another 15 to return the change. The music was too loud and they did not turn down the volume even after we requested them to. Please take note that we have not been rude to any of the servers even once through out the whole process. Now, considering the fact that the Dhanmondi branch is a relatively new outlet, the cutlery items used should still be in relatively good condition but they were not. Most of the spoons had so many scratch marks on them that it almost gave the feeling that we had been provided with used utensils from the older branches. Does not reflect the class BBQ BD claims to boast. Not a good experience overall. Not sure if I wanna go back there, not anytime soon at least. P.S.- Can provide pictures if necessary.",1.0,

"Bbq Bangladesh Dhanmondi Branch is a big disappointment, Menu card's price of each item really differs with the price of the bill,I have tried your Gulshan branch for almost 6-7times and I loved it, no complains from there.. And 2times at your dhanmondi branch.. My experience was bad both the times there.dhanmondi branch serves completely different quality of food, it's too bad , the quantity of your pane cream soup was very low.. Taste of chicken was bad and served cold. The... second time I went there, the taste of the food was average and I clearly remember that I ordered food costing around 1500 -1600tk on the menu card( Korean Charboiled chicken 3pcs chicken, 1 piece jamaican chicken meal with mashed potatoes and 3 cocacolas). They charged me the double on their bill around 3000tk. I have calculated on my own and it would have been around 1800tk-2000tk with vat and service charge. This was a clear fraud.. This might also be an inside fraud between the manager and the waiters so the authority must take this into consideration.I am never going back to bbq bangladesh again. This was not only me who faced such a problem but also I know few more people disappointed with Bbq Bangladesh dhanmondi's bill problem.",1.0,

"I ordered Golden Olive Value Meal but I cudnt find anything valuable! Whatever , this combo contains 1pc golden olive chicken ,fried cajun wedge potato, veg rice, egg n salad!

Overall experience was worst, this dish costs 345 including Vat.I never hesitate spending if the quality and taste are satisfactory, but this place was irritating enough",1.0,

"We often go to Hakka Dhaka Baily Road and every time we go there we're always very pleased with their service. The quality of their food is excellent specially the mega platter, dumplings, hot wings and kulfi are mouth-watering delicious. Along with the food Hakka Dhaka Baily Road also has a very warm, friendly and inviting environment with excellent customer service. Specially I always appreciate Saim's service, who recently got promoted to branch manager. He has always pleased us a lot. Congratulations to him for his success, the staff working under him are also pretty good, Saim is managing his branch pretty well. Today Nahid's service also pleased us.

If possible I would give it a zero. The dhanmondi branch waiters are fraud. Me and my friend took two happy meal to eat and two for parcel. They gave us smelly leftover chicken i guess. They literally lied to us that two plates will get only one kulfi so they cut the kulfi into pieces and served us. For the two parcels they said they cannot give drinks or kulfi instead they would give only one yoghurt. They literally seemed like they didn't wanted to serve us..why?? Because there was no guy with us??...even after inquiring several times they just cheated us by not serving what we paid for.....such theif waiters in a restaurant like hakka dhaka seriously??

"Yesterday we had the Happy Meal for Tk 499 and it was a very satisfying lunch. The spicy taste is what I liked most and the quantity was sufficient. The kulfi was excellent. We also ordered the Seafood Platter for 4 for takeaway. When we sat down to eat we found there wasn't enough food for all 4 of us. The fried rice, noodles, wrapped prawns and whole baked fish was sufficient but there wasn't enough crab and squid. After I called and complained to the Manager, he sent complementary dishes of each. I am impressed by his prompt action and good customer service. happy to see such professionalism. Keep up the good work!",4.0,

"Me and some of my friends had iftar here yesterday. First, I called up Hakka Dhaka Banani to make a reservation and they didn't answer my phone 5 times until someone picked up and hung up on me before I could even hear them! Then they started declining my calls after I called them again! (How rude!) I called them again with my home telephone line... And someone finally picked up and took the reservation. Unfortunately, all the tables inside were reserved and we had to sit ...outside. It's not that special outside... doesn't have a nice view or anything... just a bunch of plants to block the horrid view. And the people that usually sit there are smokers who have their iftar with a cigarette. My main problem was the noise outside. Cars were honking outside and it ruined the entire experience. My suggestion is that they should just convert that place into an indoor area. The food was alright... But a bit overpriced. The Ramadan platter was 4K for 4 people. I think for that amount, they could've thrown in some extra dishes. The noodles was just average... Everyone kept saying it was ""cocola noodles"" I hope they take notes and improve.",3.0,
"Great food! Loved the Ramadan platter. Service was good too (but needs improvement in certain areas). Overall, had a great time there with my friends and would recommend the place to anyone for a good iftar party with friends!",4.0,
I wish I can give negative marking.. Was my first time yesterday for iftar... But their way of serving food for iftar is very disappointing. When you fasting your food must be on your table so that you can eat/ate according your choice rather than you just wait for food for their serving. Exactly that was happen for every customer yesterday. Another thing iftar platter for 4 Person was 4000 bdt and I was asking myself why I paid for these kind of food.. The items all were spicy and hot that you couldn't differentiate the taste. And quantity of food was not anyone's desired....,1.0,

This was my first time yesterday. Starters were great. The main course was dissapointing really for the set platter....chicken was in the refrigerator for too long.....the noodle wrapped prawn (the one I wanted to taste) was bland.... (can spice up the prawn a bit).The prawn veggie was good and so was the beef. Most dissapointing thing was that they don't keep soft drinks at normal temperature (wierd)....come on there are children!! The best thing about the restaurant are the waiters who are helpful but a bit helpless given the circumstances!!!,3.0,

"Me and my wife went there on Baishakhi afternoon to take there Favorite meal (tk 499) meal platter during odd time. The platter was offered from 4.30 pm to 6.30 pm and we delayed our lunch just to have a taste of it. We thought to take the alternate options in our two platters so that we could have a chance to taste all the options. But when we went to order, the parser refused to give alternate options and replied that they do not take order for single platter. Even he repli...ed that if we ordered for single platter than they would refuse to serve so but it was not mentioned in anywhere in their flyer. The attitude of the parser was unfriendly. However we placed order. Then the manager came and roughly asked whats my problem. When i explained to him the issue, he became somewhat soft and said sorry. The food came. The rice and spaghetti became normal temperature and did not taste well. The mongolian beef and wrapped shrimp was good. Chicken mushroom was average. The special kulfi was good but not that much special... Overall FOOD was different, taste would be better if served hot, has areas of improvement.. Restaurant atmosphere and cleanliness was better.. But SERVICE is poor, promotional offers should be carefully designed, and the servers and managers should learn how to stay polite when they are in the wrong side of any debate... However I will go there/order online another day to get the taste of other items...",2.0,

Food is awesome.. truly delicious! A Heaven for people who love hot n spicy Chinese food! Service is not up to the mark. AC does not work well. Restaurant stuffs delay in serving food specially when we order Platter items. They serve some of the main items after serving the starters of a platter so lengthy that the customers finish having starters when they still keep bringing some 1 or 2 items which makes difficult for the customers to complete whole meal! Doesn't makes sense!!! Stuffs need to be trained about time management well to make dining meaningful!!!,3.0,

Service of the waiters can also be made more classy. Above all Food was delicious, so I would love to visit again & again.",5.0,
Ordered the PLATTER-B worth of 1300 for 2 person.. And here's what i think 1) Rock-hard beef. I know it was supposed to be dry but it's definitely not supposed to be harder than my teeth. 2) The szechuan prawn supposed to have an spicy red saucy texture. But here it's full of red grease. Looks like it came out of an old truck's engine. 3) The chicken with mushroom was okay but full of onions. Onions everywhere. 4) The dough of the dumpling was crunchy and brown. It was more like shingara. 5) The noodle was greasy and over-spicy 6) And that one star is for the fried rice which was decent.,1.0,

"I have been a regular at Hakka Dhaka ever since the very start of their venture with their small restaurant at Banani. Ever since the very beginning they realized the fact that they might be the ""under-dog"" of the industry which motivated them to provide the most superior value possible which kept me coming back time and again, but this favorite restaurant of mine disappointed me quite a bit the past couple of my visits. I believe that in order to maximize the value provided... to the customers, a good service is as crucial as good food. Even though their food remains to be fantastic, it's their service that continues to frustrate me. It really pains me to say this as one of the owners is a good acquaintance of mine but even though the management is absolutely top notch, their service providers (a.k.a. Waiters) has some of the most unsophisticated and un-professional attitude and this just keeps getting worse. It is not always possible for the management to engage the customers directly, hence it is these waiters who end up being the face of the restaurant and it is not a pretty face. Please do not take it as a sign of aggression but rather a constructive criticism from a fan of the place. I am posting this here instead of a third party forum (such as foodbank) in the hope that the management takes notice of this issue. Apologies for the rant. Regards, Faiz.",3.0,

Not everyone wants to drink juice with a steak. I know I don't. I had to get those mini water bottles you all have that taste extremely bitter. Try to get Mum and some other mineral water brands since getting water is the only option for people who don't want those juices. Also what am I s...upposed to do if I want extra wedges? Order an entire lemon chicken platter for those 5 pieces of wedges that come with it? The menu is extremely inconvenient. The platters were decorated okay. Looked aesthetically pleasing. The wedges were the only decent sides. The rice was somewhat okay too. The mashed potato and mushrooms weren't up to the mark. I had expectations from this place and I am disappointed.,2.0,

"I and my wife went to Tree House yesterday. We ordered the bento box of beef steak. The taste of all the elements of bento box was very good.

After paying that bill, we couldn't fully satisfy our hunger. The service and presentation were okay.",3.0,

"I had visited this place before, and the first time was satisfactory and for the price, they have a standard and likable menu. But as I'm writing this now there's a notable callousness from their part which can be something anyone is likely to face trouble with. I have had dinner with my family yesterday and took three of their current iftar platters alongside one sea food platter from their usual menu. The food was nothing special but it didn't lack taste either. The icecrea...m that was with the iftar platter was melted though. However, the issue that occured is when we were provided with the bill, the sea food platter stated 1597tk (vat excl.) This was startling for us as in all their menues it had 597tk written on it. When heading out we pointed it out and they merely apologised. My concern is that it is a restaurant's responsibility to correctly and accurately list down information of every item. The customers decide on a menu weighting down on both the price and food combined, an error such as this does not only put the customers at inconvenience but is mainly very misleading.",3.0,

"This is regarding dining experience at Tree House last night(18th September 2015).I am disappointed that I could not see through the reviews before agreeing to go for dinner with friends and a one year four month old.We waited one and half hours for 3 chicken steak meals and 1 beef steak meal(there was just three options to choose from).I personally feel pricing should include the 'experience' and interior for dining out,if that is so,the pricing is high because the place is ...really really really congested.There was this loud group of boys celebrating a birthday or something,but as common sense is most uncommon these days,the small space did not affect them to share incidents about their lives as loudly as possible.The staff maybe well behaved but the waiting time for food was so dispiriting(food was served as soon as we got up to leave) that there are no pictures to share.Also, if the food was extremely exciting that would have been a totally different story.Anyway,maybe it was a bad day for me or maybe my expectations do not match the common good reviews about this place,I will never frequent this place again.",1.0,

Taste depends on each person. কিন্তু আমরা ৪ জন ছিলাম, এবং কেউই খেতে পারি নাই।। বাদ্ধ্য হয়ে sauce , mayonnaise and pepper দিয়ে কোনো ভাবে গিলে এসেছি ।। Interior এর অবস্থা কমেন্ট এ দিচ্ছি। সামনে পেপ্সি , মিরিন্ডার বোতল রেখে আলাদা গ্লাসে serve করে ২৫ টাকা রাখার মানে বুঝলাম না!!!!!!!!",1.0,

"In a city of bricks and concretes, yesterday I chose to be at a place like ""Triangle cafe"" for Iftar. The place is situated just beside 3/a Dhanmondi lake, if you're a nature lover like me then its the perfect place for enjoying the soothing weather and gentle breeze of this monsoon. Triangle had two platers, one with a rice bowl and the other offering chowmein. Being a chowmein lover I ordered plater 2 and I have to agree the food was great in quality and sufficient in quantity for one. The BBQ chicken is a must try and also the kebab roll was juicy and spicy. The chowmein tasted perfectly seasoned. Both the platers are priced 450/- BDT all inclusive. I will recommend everyone who is looking for an escape out of this city sensationalism, Triangle is your place to feel the nature and enjoy a quality time with mouthwatering food.",5.0,

When called, the waiter told that it was a mistake and brought all the muttons together in a seperate bowl. Two pieces of mutton for each person and the pieces were very tiny. the firni was like baby food (semolina) and there was no raisin in it. Jarda was of no difference.

"From my wandering of tasting a good, decent steak, I found my end to this journey in Bangladesh. They serve you the steak full of juicy, tender and gorgeous look. People from inside are friendly enough to give you the proper description of what you are going to have in your plate. I enjoyed every single bite of it. (y) to them. And surely, I would love to visit them again and again.",5.0,

"Went there last Friday with my friend, got surprised a bit seeing such a small place. Upon arrival they waiter attended us with details of their menu as they prepare steaks in two types of Texas style with some deviations. We selected a Sirloin and Tomahawk, which were 300g and 500g. The truth is we were a bit skeptic about the weight they were mentioning but to our surprise they showed us the raw steaks that they were about to prepare for us. This was a nice touch. Liked the... way they ask customers approval for the cuts before preparing it as they were doing it for all the guests in other tables too. After waiting for around 30 mins, the steaks arrived. We ordered medium done and medium rare the steaks were exactly like we ordered. The medium rare Tomahawk tasted even better than my medium done Sirloin. Both the steaks had sof juicy center with flavorful seared crusts. Loved every bite of the tender steak till the end. The portion is quite hefty along with the sides of mashed potato and sautee vegetables. The sauces were nice compliment to the steak, would recommend their roast bacon glace for sure. This will be my steak place from now on for as long as they serve steaks like that.",5.0,

Great Steaks. Best part they showed the steak portions before grilling it. Quantity was good. definitely a place to try out.,,True
"First glimpse will depict a small cozy diner bustling with energy as I have been there at dinner time. Fortunately we got our seats as we reserved earlier that day through phone. Ordered a Ribeye and Sirloin which were 300g each as per menu and done in true Texas style, which I was a bit skeptic at first. Then to my surprise they bought the raw cut in front of us and asked if we liked the cut and marbling. This is something we never experience in any steakhouse before, no one... asks about marbling of the meat in any steakhouse so far I have visited in Bangladesh. I started loving the place form that moment as the Ribeye had very good marbling in it. Just after that they served us complementary corn soups which were good gesture from their behalf and it was good too. Had to wait nearly 25 mins before we got the food and my friend asked the waiter why it takes this long to serve, then we came to know about the smoking process. They actually smoke each and every steak with imported woodchips and when we asked if they could show us the woodchips they certainly did, mixture of dry Apple & Hickory woodchips! Finally the steaks arrived and wow, perfectly seared medium rare steaks with juicy slight red center and dark crust outside. The first bite actually depicted all about that smoking stuff and for real it felt like I having a real steak, which I have seen for so long in TLC and other TV shows. The perfect thickness, sides of mashed potato and amazing sauces, though I did not like to use sauce in steaks as they are supposed to be juicy for medium rare done and in this case it was. Their service was good too as the waiters were polite and knowledgeable. This is my new favorite place for steaks and would highly recommend if anyone is looking for thick cut juicy steaks in Dhaka.",5.0,
"Good food, nice place and great music. Definitely one of the best steak place in Dhaka.",,True

Excellent and tasty there beef steak and side dishes,,True
Space is too small. We ordered Texas Tornado which was awful! No taste at all. Then we ordered Poutine. I asked for little salt and pepper. They couldn't give me Salt. Poutine was not up to the mark!

"*** Negative review *** I was in love with Woodhouse Grill, seeing all their positive reviews and the amazing looking steaks. But all that glitters was just eye washing for us. We ordered one tomahawk, two sirloin and one t-bone steak. All were medium rare. And we rarely tasted steak like those. It was absolute raw and chewy like a tire. Only one sirloin steak came out good that means they can make the steak worth it's money but messed up with other three. After complaining t...hey heated that again but we were even unable to cut it . Highly dissatisfied and disappointed. Place - Wood house grill Food rating - 2 ( for that one steak )",,False

"It was nice. My family and I are steak lovers. They Could improve in the actual cooking of the steaks. When a customer wants medium or rare or well done, they should know precisely how much time it takes to cook the steak. Steak really goes well with baked potatoes and steamed vegetables. They should introduce baked or jacket potatoes. Would certainly visit again. The washroom could be better maintained. Thanks",4.0,
You got the best steak in entire town.All the items are mouthwatering,,True
"In recent times, I've tasted many dishes but none has come close to the taste and deliciousness of the steaks of this place. The steak piece is so tender and juicy, meat juice literally comes out when you cut a piece of the steak. The side dishes with the steak are also delicious specially the sauces. The sauses enhanced the flavor of the steak. When i put a piece of steak in my mouth, it felt so good.I dare say, this place is the best place to get steak if you want taste, quality and quantity. i will come here again to taste everything asap. N.B.- The environment and the music of this place is excellent. Also the service was great Good luck to this place",5.0,

I went to Woodhouse Grill on Friday and was shocked to see such a small restaurant with no space between tables. It seems the tables are joining each other. Their prices are quite expensive considering that this is a very small restaurant in a small congested space. The service was poor. We were told that the food would arrive 45 mins. after ordering but the food arrived later. I suggested the owner to serve all the food together at a time instead of serving each order separ...ately. We ordered a t bone steak medium well which was brought out medium rare with blood remaining inside. We also ordered a sirloin medium well which was very dry. The steaks are kept frozen and after cooking it was not at all juicy. We also ordered grill chicken which was ok. The waiters are not well trained and don't know when to serve the drinks which should have arrived right after ordering but instead I had to remind the waiter yo bring out the drinks almost 30 mins. after ordering the drinks. Its a ok place but they need to improve service quality and better quality steak.,2.0,

"Went to Woodhouse Grill today. Already I had an Experience about the Steak in Bangladesh. So as usual with timid heart and boosted morale entered to the venue. Little small but neat and clean.....the employees are very cordial...soft spoken and well trained. They I have seen describing the customers in detail about the type of cut, dish and side dishes. I have met the owner little latter. He was also very cordial and helpful. To taste for the 1st time....I asked for a Pepper ...Steak and level of cooking I asked is Medium well done. I received the food and cut the piece of meat....the knife was smooth and I put the first piece in my mouth.....mmmmm....delicious.....but the cooking was Well Done. The owner observed my food and he was not satisfied with the cooking level, he returned my steak back and served another steak cooked in perfection as Medium Well Done. The incident depict how sincere and customer oriented they are. I am fully satisfied and wish to go frequently there. If the remain committed regarding their standard and customer satisfaction no doubt they will rise above the horizon....Viva Woodhouse Grill. I definitely recommend to taste the steak in Woodhouse Grill.",5.0,

"Had a bad experience at FoodBuzz banasree. Yesterday I went there with my family. As all the tables were filled up we waited for some time. Then one table was empty and the waiter accommodated us that table. But a little while later when we were about to order food the waiter came and said this table was booked and we must leave it. They wanted us to give another table but there was no Air Conditioning there. So we had to leave the restaurant. Before leaving I told the incident to the man sitting in cash counter. But none of them simply apologized for it. Its only because of traffic jam and lack of good restaurants in banasree, we have visit such third class restaurants who do not even know what is customer service. This was my first and last visit to this restaurant.",1.0,

Thanks to #foodbuzz for making a special day ‘Super Special’! Today I want to express my gratitude to foodbuzz who unconditionally helped me create a special memory! I wanted to give a surprise to my special one on our Aniversiry.The initial plan was to gather at foobuzz with all our friends and spend a nice time together. But I wasn’t sure if the people from there would cooperate without any booking or any charge. So I called at the number from their Facebook page and I was surprised instead at the enthusiasm and willingness they showed.There isn’t much I can do to repay them but I at least wanted to thank them here and inform people about their hospitality,5.0,

"Place : #foodbuzz ok so before I start rating their food and service and what not let me start off by saying what they did right that other restaurants usually don't. 1st - The food actually looks as they were advertised. 2nd - They actually served the food hot, yes you heard it right ""HOT"" this is where a lot of restaurant fails. They served all the food at the right time and in right order. ok now let's move on to what you guys really care about. Items -9/10 :kabsha, chusanut salad. Taste -9/10: I don't believe in perfection but this came pretty close, I would still rate it 9 but I gave 10 for a reason and I'll explain that in a bit. So anyway the chusanut salad really hot when it was served and it was tasty as well. Every item on that platter was upto the mark. Sorry I don't know the name of all the items otherwise I would've explained each item by their taste. Quantity: [10/10]: I don't know how much you can eat but I can eat a lot and I can tell you it's more than enough for 4 person.",5.0,

"Update about the Rating: This was one of my favorite place for hanging out with fnf. But faced something awkward and irritating in my last visit. Totally unprofessional behavior, if there's some problem to serve a specific item to me then it's better not to serve the same item to other while I am in your restaurant. I tried to order a specific item but the server said this item is not available, ok cool. I have gone for another item. but a Minute later I could see and hear t...hey were taking the same item's order from the next table. I didn't want to complain about the mismanagement at the cafe as some other visitor was there, I thought it would be better If I write it down to their complain book, so I asked for their complain book but they don't have a feedback or complain book. OMG. Rather the server insisted me to complain the problem to him directly, I denied and later the manager or accountant came to explain the scenario. Now come to the food part: I had ordered ""Schezwan Chicken, Rice"" and ""Mongolian Beef"" where the quantity was really poor and it doesn't even close to Schezwan Chicken's look or taste. Mongolian Beef's beef was hard to chew and again quantity was poor too. Old Rating: I will recommend this place to have the Fresh Juice and French Fries there.

Their lemon loaf is fantastic. But the salad is a deep disappointment. One teaspoon of dressing doesn't make the hearty portion any better. Also the flavours of chicken is very blunt.

Outrageous increase in prices. Mejo options for Chas are gone. A cha will now cost 120. Add ons to Wraps have been reduces. The portions have decreased. This all with ever deteriorating service. Extremely disappointing that a store with so much potential of creating a difference is now becoming an undifferentiated commercial business. This WAS my go to place for lunch. (Mejo wrap and Cha). Will be looking at other options where 400 taka can be spent on food and service (and doesnt operate from a market with poor seating options given how much I have to spend).,,False

The food is amazing but yesterday was the 4th time they either didn't have a wrap and can only give salad bowls or didn't have one of the two beef or chicken.

"The place is clean and the staff are very friendly , however I believe the management is very stingy. Most of the menus were 6 pieces ( pen corrected from 8.) instead of 8 pieces. The beef and chicken vegetable - are shamelessly small quantity and flooded with gravy to fill the plate. I have never seen such a Chinese dish with Indian curry like gravy and small portions . The manager might be trying to save money to have higher bonus . I believe any restaurant inspector will... Despite specifically requested for little or no chilies- the foods were served with red and green chilies and when complained they waived the price of ice cream (5 out of 10). I would spend my money some where else next time.",2.0,
"Environment is good, food is also tasty but you need to give more attention on your service quality, waiters are not available when we need, even they have no combination in giving service, 3-4 waiters are giving service in one table other people’s are waiting, so you need to much improve in management, Otherwise it was pretty good ��",4.0,
"Had the pleasure of visiting this restaurant on my short, but memorable trip to Dhaka almost two summers ago. The environment is clean and neat unlike the dark, dimly lit restaurants found lurking all over Dhaka city. The food and service were absolutely divine. Coming to Dhaka I realized nothing is truly authentic, you are expected to run into the fusions here. This restaurant takes the hat in asian fusion food. The exotic looking menu and the fresh quality food here was something remembered from my South Asia tour. Congratulations to the restaurant on holding their standard high over the course of the years. Locals say it's been around for more than 20 years and it shows in their service! I look forward to coming back and try those crabs again!",5.0,

"Worst than the worst Iftar platter I had yesterday with my colleagues at Gulshan 1 branch and none of them said anything different. when u complain about their food they'll tell you that they maintain food quality religiously in this month of Ramadan. Everyone likes food to be served hot, u don't need to remind that to your customer. Accept that you are of no good quality, there are plenty other good coffee shops in the town. We eat the food not the franchise. Iftar platter... had bland chicken hariyali kebab, fish fritters were way too much fried and cold, spicy grilled chicken with the friend rice was actually without any spice. I am sorry to say it was overall tasteless. Coleslaw with the chicken lemon oli was sour and inedible. I always had good expectations on GJ regarding food but you guys just did a very bad job in this month of Ramadan. Couldn't resist myself to make a point on it. Hope you guys will work on it.",1.0,

"I have been a regular customer of Gloria Jean's of Gulshan 1 and Gulshan 2 branches, since there opening at Dhaka, Bangladesh.Their caramel machiato, chillers and chiken lollipops are my all time favourites, but today It has happened. my love for gloria jeans has crossed the sky limit.

I contacted with them and told what happened and later there was an awesome person from that branch... named Shahid who assured me that he found the mug and asked me to collect it from the cash counter.

I am not sure because of where you are located, you feel privileged to rip off your paying customers & assume we are a bunch of idiots, or that we won't bother with your microscopic itemised ""imported receipts!"" I recommend you use a fund raising box if you are so desperate. At least we will know the local Café is not trying to take us for a ride!!!

"Gloria Jean's Coffees Bangladesh- it's a coffee shop where coffee tastes horrible and other dishes taste quite well. They don't even concentrate on improving the taste of the Coffees. They are constantly trying to improve other dishes which are easily found in other ""restaurants"". I repeat ""Restaurants"". Last I checked Gloria jeans is not a restaurant, it's a coffee shop. My question is- Has Gloria jeans become a restaurant or is it still a coffee shop? You guys are selling... deserts, fried rice, burgers and many other things very efficiently and they taste quite good as well. But when it comes to your coffee, they taste like shit. I have been going there for a long time and it's unacceptable from a great coffee shop like this one. I have been going to various coffee shops for a long time and that's how I developed a keen taste for Coffees. I know the variations of Coffees and the taste of them. In other coffee shops, the variations of coffee is quite amazing. Here one day I ordered ""cafe mocha"" and it tasted as usual. The next time I went there, I ordered a ""cappuccino"". I couldn't even differentiate between those two because both of them tasted the same. There is no depth and aroma in these coffees. If I can't find the variations among the different types of Coffees, then why the hell anyone should come here to taste these horrible Coffees with such high prices? They certainly maintain a standard about other dishes and they taste really good. But as a coffee shop, they don't deserve to get a rating of 1.",1.0,

Rotten chicken sandwich and disgraceful service as argued they serves like this.,1.0,
I went there yesterday. It was a busy time. I ordered Steam rice with Steam chicken for me and Grilled chicken for my friend. Unfortunately both chicken were cold but part of the grilled chicken was very cold. I ordered Latte and at last but to be honest it was cold as well. the Waiters need to be little bit more trained as I was looking for them at least 7-10 mins to clean my table and also they should have some knowledge about the food. Overall I can not give more than 3 star this time. Hope next time I will have a more good experience. Thanks,3.0,

good environment with good food,,True
Environment & view is good as usual but need to develop their behavior with customers. Waiters behavior was not bad but the behavior of the manager was not appreciable. Only 10-15 Items were in buffet but maximum were tasteless. Desert items were good. So need to change the food menu & u can include some items. Be ensure the customers' satisfactions with behaviors & food qualities. Thank u,5.0,

The food was excellent.But the decoration was really impressive and presented a warm environment.The owner came to attend us by himself and all the work he put to make this place as such was evident.A lovely person indeed.He also offered a special dish to us for free and the taste of that dish was really unique.,5.0,
Unprofessional service. After they served the food in our table some 15/20 young university kids came to celebrate one of their friends' birthday and we were about to start eating that moment a staff came to us saying sorry this table was reserved so if we can move to some other table. Being a gentle person I told them what kind of service is this.. but eventually gaveup the table for the kids. Actually it wasn't reserved and those kids used that table to dump their backpacks. Anyways food was not something special or cheaper compared to so many batter places it town. Those who reviewed 5 stras should try different places too. 😑,,False

So whr do i start. Been half an hour nd um writing this. Order placed at 7 28 pm Mountain dew... Net bdt 760 token 93 july 3 At 7 55 they gave me the chicken pop nd said thryll give the rest in 5 mins. After 5 mins they sent the shake. 8 pm. Meanwhile we were 2 of us. We were done with the chicken pop by 8 20 nd at 8 25 they sent the coleslaw nd burger. It looked terribly funny that yet they dint give the wings. What m i supposed to have the coleslaw with . Your head? I finished the burger at 8 35ish ns went to the counter asking them bbq wings kothay. They said 7 more mins. I said ill take take away nd asked them to take back their coleslaw. They agreed. But when they took it back the waiter said sorry aita khawa. I said impossible. U have to take it back. If necessary pack the wings with a mountain dew. But what will i do with ur ckoslaw served this late with burger. Keu ki burger diye coleslaw khabe. ? Ok finally they agreed again. When i was leaving with the bbq wings nd mountain dew. They offered a 25 tk exchange. I said keep it. And very rudely they said no i wont keep ur money. Take it. I angrily said i wont nf statted to walk away. 3 ppl near the kitchen screamed at me saying never come back. Now let me ratw ur food. Shake was ok. 9/10 Burger was disgusting. 2/10 Chicken pop was 5/10 Um yet to have the wings but ur horrible experience wont allow me to digest ur food. I am never coming back nd i know it wont bother you. Thing is. The person i went at your place with said quite a few times to go nf sit sumwhr nd i replied na its a good place naam shunsi. Baki gular naam o shuninai. I wont ask ppl not to go thr. I will ask ppl to go to ur place for some beautiful experience . Cheers. If the owner sees this. The food can be skipped.

nice place and food was to good,,True
"The first glance of the place with its magnificent Lebanese inspired decorations immediately gave out an impression of the middle east. Simple yet subtle. The moment I took a bite of the kabab, I felt like I was back in the Arabian peninsula. The soft arabian music and the lightings and ofcourse the humble waiters dressed in the finest attires helped to complement the feel I suppose. They really did deliver the so called Arab ""ZAYKA"". If nothing else the chefs of this place are some of the finest artists in the world. A 5 star rating would not suffice to describe the experience. I offer them my compliments and look forward to their future endeavours.",5.0,
I just love this place . nd the food was too good.,,True
First of all the decoration of the place is too beautiful. It increases with the Lebanese songs. The food we ordered was happy hour set menu which was so delicious specially the chicken mushroom curry and rice. Quantity was also good for single person. The sauce needs to be better as it was slight spicy. Chicken was average. The behaviour of the staffs was not good that I experienced. I found them kinda rude. When we were selecting the food from the menu they immigrated showed us another menu and said may be we could not afford that. That was so insulting though we all stayed there to taste the food. Overall the experience was good except the behaviour of the staffs.,4.0,

"I did not find the food comparable to authentic Arabic food - the Khabsah for one , was the worst. The others were better , and OK. Did not taste like real KSA food or Arabic food , to be honest . They did serve a garlic sauce, which appeared to have been made by someone who never tasted real garlic sauce from the mid- east. The owners need to visit the mid- east before they can successfully add that Arabic touch to their food.",3.0,
I enjoyed the food. And their service also. I would recommend this resturent.,4.0,
Last year when I visited Al Amar I was really happy with their service and authentic Lebanese taste. I actually found the Arabic taste same as abroad. Today I had a dinner in Al Amar and still I found the same quality and service. Regarding the taste of the food it's amazing and un explainable. Really recommended and I will inspire everyone to visit Al Amar at least once and try their Mix Grill / Hummus and Lemon with mint(Drinks),5.0,

"Yaa habibi!! The hummus is divine, the tahine thick and rich, and the décor and music all transport you to a magical Mediterranean realm. Al-Amar features a wide variety of Lebanese as well as Oriental dishes. True that the price is somewhat above the average range for restaurants in the area, but it's still within reasonable limits given the quality and portions of the food served, and the warm service received. The drinks are interestingly refreshing. We opted for the hummus and kafta antabli (lamb skewers), the ice honey tea and mint lemonade. Not disappointed at all. Very pleasant atmosphere too.",5.0,

"We placed an order over the phone for takeaway and were told that food would be ready in approximately 35 mins. I went after 45 mins to pick up the food and it still wasn't ready. I had to wait another 10 mins for them to prepare the parcel. Other than this setback, let's get into the food review: 1) Lamb Kabseh, priced at 645++. The meat & rice were cooked well and the portions were sufficient for 2 (provided you take some appetizers). However, I did not really like the over...whelming tomato taste. I prefer a drier kabseh with bigger portions of meat and garlic sauce but that's just my opinion. I'd rate this 2.5/5. Since it's quite pricey, I don't really recommend this. 2) Hommos, priced at 325++. Although this may sound too expensive for just mashed chickpeas with a bit of oil and mild seasoning, trust me it's worth it. Portions are more than enough to share for 2 (you can even take this for 3). Also, you can get extra bread for 20 taka each if you do run out of bread. I'd rate this 4/5. Highly recommended. 3) Lahem Bi Ajin, priced at 300++. These are mini beef keema pizzas which taste fantastic!!! Initially I was expecting a gravy dish because the description says 'marinated minced beef cooked with spices & tomatoes the traditional way' and was kinda bummed out when I saw mini pizzas but once I took a bite, I was blown away. They also give you a slice of yellow lemon (proper imported yellow lemon, and not the crap we get here which are being passed off as lemons) which adds so much to the flavor of the dish. 5/5, I'd have this everytime I go there. And since you get 8 slices, it's superb value for money for 2 people. My total bill was 1537 BDT (including 6% service charge and 15% VAT). I am quite confused as to why I had to pay service charge for a takeaway order, they definitely should remove that. Otherwise, it's not too heavy on the pocket for something different (provided you don't take the kabseh).",4.0,

Very disappointed with their behavior.... we around 51 people booked them for iftar. Took their highest price iftar menu but their food quantity is very poor. They were very unprofessional and rude in behavior. At the time of iftar they forgot to serve one item listed in the menu but we didn't shout just politely informed them. And it took so long to serve the rest item that we already had finished our iftar. After iftar we stayed and we ordered aprox 20 cup of coffeee and paid the bill of that extra coffee but still they were forcing us to leave their restaurant and we were surprised at their such unprofessional attitude. They might not have experience to handle a crowd or any party booking. CAUTION: PLEASE THINK BEFORE ARRANGING ANY GATHERING OR PARTY BOOKING HERE.,1.0,

"The place is clean and the staff are very friendly , however I believe the management is very stingy. Most of the menus were 6 pieces ( pen corrected from 8.) instead of 8 pieces. The beef and chicken vegetable - are shamelessly small quantity and flooded with gravy to fill the plate. I have never seen such a Chinese dish with Indian curry like gravy and small portions . The manager might be trying to save money to have higher bonus . I believe any restaurant inspector will... reject this ( if there is a licensing authority -unfortunately there is none ) . Despite specifically requested for little or no chilies- the foods were served with red and green chilies and when complained they waived the price of ice cream (5 out of 10). I would spend my money some where else next time.",2.0,
"Environment is good, food is also tasty but you need to give more attention on your service quality, waiters are not available when we need, even they have no combination in giving service, 3-4 waiters are giving service in one table other people’s are waiting, so you need to much improve in management, Otherwise it was pretty good ��",4.0,
"Had the pleasure of visiting this restaurant on my short, but memorable trip to Dhaka almost two summers ago. The environment is clean and neat unlike the dark, dimly lit restaurants found lurking all over Dhaka city. The food and service were absolutely divine. Coming to Dhaka I realized nothing is truly authentic, you are expected to run into the fusions here. This restaurant takes the hat in asian fusion food. The exotic looking menu and the fresh quality food here was something remembered from my South Asia tour. Congratulations to the restaurant on holding their standard high over the course of the years. Locals say it's been around for more than 20 years and it shows in their service! I look forward to coming back and try those crabs again!",5.0,

I asked the waiter what is your problem? Then he said me that ""Sir, plz take this bill, we consider 1 drinks from ur list. Then I shout on him and said that give me my proper bill. He went to the cash counter and came with (3rd time) new bill and said me that ""We consider your ""3 Feezy Per Glass 150tk"" then I was too angry and call the Manager, and said that what kind of behavior this is. We don't need ur consideration. We just need our proper bill that's it. Why don't u give us our proper bill which we ate. Then the Manager give us a bill (4th time) where they mention ""3 Coke Bottle 60tk"".

"The first question ""how do people rate sush a kind of restaurant 4 of 5""??!!!! Is it done by the restaurant people or genuinely people have such bad taste with no good food experience at all!!! ( SURPRISINGLY Over-rated ) The food quality is not good.. The platter is not at all worthier may b they brush with burnt burnt and used oil. Butter nan has no butter it dry and when you eat its sandy!! All the appetite will go seeing the glass they use for serving fresh juice.. Juice taste is not good either you can only taste rock salt! Price is too high which derives to disappointment. The only good thing was the Beef Achari that tastes better though beef pieces were supplemented by achar thus the name should be ""Achari Beef""..

I did order dosa as well, which she ate thankfully. But I am sorry to say, hyderabadi biriyani tasted like jorda with mutton pieces. Hope you will look into this matter. Thank you.",2.0,

"As I'm writing this review it's breaking my heart that my favorite restaurant's quality has fallen so much...the other day I ordered 'palak paneer and aloo paratha..n palak paneer was rotten...I informed you about that...n today I m at your place and we face almost same situation. We ordered 1 khichuri thali and one Naan thali and one chicken butter masala. ... 1) khichuri thali: shockingly there was a hair in khichuri! !! My pregnant sis was craving for your khichuri..we or...dered 2 hours before we reach tarka so that we can get the khichuri thali...and that's what she get??? Amazing! There was another time I got hair on my salad but I overlooked it..but today! !! Anyway. ..now the bhortas. ..whenever we ordered khichuri thali we got Taki machher bhorta. .. and today we got tasteless, flooded with mustard oil alu bhorta which we weren't informed before. .when my sis asked the waiter he gave a lame explanation that is 'amra ekekdin ekek bhorta dei' how come we never got any other bhorta!! Lameness er limit thake..if you ran out of food..you could inform us!!and the Kala bhuna...we requested that the last timewe orderedit was so hard that we could hardly eat..n today..it was just same!! UNEXPECTED 2) Naan thali: I ordered garlic Naan..they served plain Naan...when I complain they replaced it with garlic Naan..it it was hard and cold...though they heat it..it was hard...I don't know what happened to tarkas that Naan. ..which used to melt in mouth....everything in the thali was cold. ..daal was more like home made daal chorchori...n palak paneer. ..saltless. ..tasteless. ..it didn't even had the buttery texture it used to have....DISAPPOINTED 3)chicken butter masala : taste was good...but the ratio according to price is very very poor..I tried chicken butter masala before but I had no idea that your restaurant serves it with minced chicken. Anyway...your restaurant was our favorite place..but after having back to back horrible experience. ..my n my family quit...we are never coming back. ..highly dissatisfied and hurt. ..all the best",1.0,

"There was a time not long ago when the choice for good authentic Indian restaurant in Dhaka was limited to Sajna and Khazana only, and then came Tarka with their mind blowing ""never tasted"" authentic Indian menu in a casual yet classy ambiance. So far I have tried all of their lunch thalis (except Veggie and Rice, as I am not much into those), and from their regular menu mutton hyderbadi biriyani, chicken lagawab makhani, beef boti, chickten tikka, khusnama kabab, daal butter... fry, matar paneer, mughal chicken, kashmiri/butter/garlic nan and I can't rank anyone better than the other as for their quality is 5 star. As for the drinks my favorite is Jeera Pani. It's also good to see that their service level has drastically improved since their inception and now I don't mind paying the 7% service charge. Also a nice addition was their Iftar menu during Ramadan and particularly the 'haleem' which I fell in love after first sip. I have intentionally held off my review until now as I wanted to test them over time for their consistency which they have proved so far. Keep up the great taste & service and wish you all the best in the business.",5.0,

After about ten minutes they came back with the pani puri. I finished my meal while my wife was still waiting for her beef roll which arrived even after the take away food was ready. To add to all this misery regarding the service, the food was horrible. Not worth the time, anxiety, or money. Not going back unless the entire serving staff is changed or trained properly.

The best place to have authentic Japanese food. Fresh food with great taste. The presentation of food is really nice. I would recommend this place for fine dining.,,True
Their foods are best in town till date. The ambiance and the behavior of servers are good as well! Highly recommended :),,True
"Fine dining? eh? Very own app? Using some garbage 3rd party app that's not even built for a specific restaurant. Does not work properly. Has so many bugs. And finally, takes 5 minutes to place an order...and then someone has to accept it from Umai...which nobody does. 10 minutes wasted lmao. 25% discount if order through app? But only for one item in cart! Ordered Chicken Karaage. Came without any Soy sauce. Dry af tiny crispy chicken without any taste. Next up Umai Special Creamy Salmon Roll and another Salmon Roll. Big in names; tiny in sizes. Yuuuge in prices. Have had these types of foods in many other places but yours are by far the worse in taste, size but super high on the price. Your 1300tk stuff is worth at most 400tk. I don't mind paying 1.3k or even 2k for a few pieces of rolls. But the food quality has to match, right?",1.0,
Just love their food. Environment is peaceful.,,True
"Love this place! They are a fine dining establishment, with really great food, great service and, as expected, a hefty price tag against every item available. Despite of the feeling of despair I get whilst paying the bill, I still managed to go there a number of times, and haven't been disappointed once However, my latest visit was yesterday, and this time around, I faced a serious problem which prompted me to write this review. We ordered ""Beef Udon Noodles"" which is a fav...orite of my wife, and at the very end of the dish, we found some coiled strings. These things definitely came from the wired sponges that are used for scrubbing the plates when a dish washer is not available. So the person who cleaned the plates wasn't competent, and the chef was not vigilant enough to check this before serving the dish. It wasn't a big deal, but we had a bad feeling. We kind of lost our appetite, and called in the waiter to tell this to his manager. Knowing Bangladeshi restaurants, we weren't hoping for much. However, the manager came in almost running, and profusely apologized. He wanted to replace the dish. But by then, we were full and didn't have the appetite to eat more. So I refused. Then the manager told us that he will remove the bill for the noodles, and we can have any main dish from the menu for free. When I said we are no longer hungry, he said we can also have it made for ""take away"". By then, I was quite surprised. I haven't really seen such behavior from any other restaurant in Dhaka. But then again, I also did not find strings in the food in any other restaurant. But that is not really the point, the point is the nice gesture shown by Umai. After declining this generous offer, the manager seemed sad and apologized again and left. After 4-5 minutes, I asked for the bill, and the waiter informed that we will be served complimentary desserts and then the bill will be given. This was something I could not refuse. So me, my wife and child totally enjoyed the free Banana Katsu dessert (which was the most expensive dessert in the menu) and came out with a satisfied mind. I hope they continue this kind of customer service and improve the kitchen vigilance. I wish them all the best as I want them to stick around and keep on serving us high quality Japanese food.",5.0,

I was first time goer to Umai last evening. It was a great evening with my cousin-sister & sister like friend.

"Such a overpriced menu! Prices are more than even Sydney :O There are lots of sushi/Bento shops around Sydney City, provides more quantities/varieties in Bento with even lesser price (around $6-$10 = BDT 350-550) Sushi long each $3-$4 (150-240 BDT) Considering cost in Sydney (place and stuff cost in Sydney at least 10 times than BD..) what would be the reason of such high price??",3.0,

They are clearly cheating with their customer in the name of buy 1 get 1 free. I used to love their food but after being there last time I was really shocked.

Then i told him - are you gonna give me a refund or should i walk away without a refund.. They did give me a refund after wasting almost an hour but the sad thing is the cashier wasn't sorry or felt any remorse. Was expecting a sorry but his attitude was pretty far from a sorry..

I have always been a great fan of Lucknow. I have always found it homely since inception of Horitoki (it's previous name). But I would like to point out that: Staff: some of them are great but sometimes some of their staff seem indifferent to needs & Food: Their mixed vegetables contain more carrot than other veggies. First I thought it could be a random issue but later I found it to be true. I understand cutting cost but not expected from a high end restaurant like Lucknow.,4.0,
Nice place with good food.,,True
"I m absolutely loved the food, The only thing that Lucknow does better than thier food is their service.

Me and my husband went there yesterday with our two kids. We went for lunch and that time most of the tables were empty and we wanted to sit at a corner table but the waiter told if there'll be more people they won't be able to sit and showed us a table just with the entrance gate. It was almost the ending time of lunch hour so how can they expect more guests and how rude was their behavior I was wondering. Although we didn't take that sit and choose another one. But this shouldn't be the behavior with the guests. Anyways foods were good.. handi biriany was horrible.. price is too high.. too 1 hour to serve the dishes.. service is too bad.. I don't recommend this place to anyone. Worst service I've ever seen.,3.0,
The food is overpriced compared to the taste and quantity and the staffs are so ill mannered. Moreover they have a huge menu book but they don’t have half the food available. Really disappointing.,,False
undoubtedly best kabab in the town. every time I visited the restaurant they have made their standards better than before. Consistancy of their food taste and quality is equal yet.,5.0,
i really love their food but the service need to better a lil bit .. bcoz last night i went there waiter was a lil bit off like he was bother that we were asking qus or ordering food.. after we done eating when i was looking for the person to can give us the bill . i saw another person i was calling him but he looked at me straight and left didnt even bother to come to out table .. i really didnt like that attitude .. plz do talk to the waiters .. that how to do customer service.. i know not all the waiters r not same .. but few of them have a bad attitude problme.. thank you.. i hope u will find the solution for this,,True
"Hello. My family as well as myself are very frequent customers at Lucknow. Sad to say, today was by far the worst experience I've had. The orders were placed to be taken away. 1. I've ordered a Beef Bhuna; now from my frequent orders, I know what to expect. It is always served cut in to little cubes. Today I got 2 bones and 2 chunks in the item out of which consisted of fat. This was never the case. 2. I've ordered for Chicken Butter Masala. Once I reached home I came to disc...over that it tastes different. I didn't bother checking the receipt before I left because Lucknow has never failed to reach my expectations, but when I did, it was listed Chicken Tikka Masala. 3. The condiments (salad and dressings) were missing. 4. The Naushijan Vegetable Biriani hardly had any vegetables other than potatoes. Also it was extremely spicy.",1.0,

"Horrible food. Shouldn't have listen to my wife to go there in the first place. We went there at 2:30PM and server told us kitchen will be closed at 3 and we have to order fast with an attitude.

"Let's talk about the place first. Located at the edge of Sat Masjid Road near the Dhanmondi 27 turning, which provides to be central location for people coming in from Mohammadpur, Lalmatia or Dhanmondi. While they do not have a dedicated parking place they try to make up for it by having numerous guards. Interior is very nice. Well decorated, modern and unlike some very dimly lit restaurants opening up nowadays, this proved to be a welcoming experience offering something qui...te on the contrary. The ambience is very inviting with music in the background and ample room between tables to not overhear the conversations from tables nearby. We were a family of four. After being handed the menu which had decent amount of items we ordered a standard Chinese dinner for my parents whilst me and my sister opted for something from the Indian cuisine. We had ordered more than our table of four could accumulate so were moved to a bigger table. Food was served within approximately 20 mins. The food was good, my parents seemed to enjoy the Chinese cuisine and from little of what I tasted i felt the quality was certainly there. My order of tandoori chicken was good but I felt the butter nan to be pretty dry. The owner as well as the manager came around to ask if the food was okay and I let them know of my dry experience of the nan and they immediately changed it. The second batch of nan was much better. Service proved to be admirable and quite helpful when needed. The staff behavior was excellent. All in all it was a great dining experience. A lot of the food we ordered were leftover so we packed it to take home. They gave us a promotional discount but the final bill without the discount seemed reasonable, we were actually expecting the bill to be more but pleasantly surprised. One of the managers actually walked us to our car while leaving. This feeling of exclusiveness felt great and really made you feel the restaurant is keen on delivering good food and service. Hope they are able to maintain this standard in the future. FINAL VERDICT: Location: 9/10 Interior: 10/10 Food: 10/10 Service: 10/10 Price: 9/10",5.0,
"On of my favourite resturant, loved the food specially guwalati kabab and veg biryani.... Yummy",5.0,
Food was good. Service was great. Most delicious was grilled vetki and tandoori prawn. Kababs were average. Handi biriyani was ok. All other items were good enough. But the mutton nehari needs to improve. Also the shahi tukra was a bit weird. It tasted spicy and sweet both. But it should be sweet only. Kulfi was great. Price is too high. Thank you.,4.0,
At first we asked their service man about something spicy from their menu.They suggest to take Kofta biriyani.Taste was worst.We did not find any evidence of spice there.And I don't know why the hell they are taking service charge?Even they did not serve the platter.None of them ask to serve it as well.But papor was good enough as a starter.Decoration was good enough.But disappointed with food.,1.0,

"Yesterday I paid a sudden visit to here.. Fortunately found a comfartable corner to spend an hour & became emotional for having seats without any hassle in the Eid vacation. I had some dishes like BBQ pasta, 4 season pizza, shrimp pizza sandwich.. Aaah! Just grabbed that pasta � But the shrimp pizza sandwich was not up to the mark..u should improve the taste of this Due to having closer from my home the place, food & menu was highly acceptable to me ☺",5.0,

"Having a restaurant like this just next to my house is a blessing. We people with friends used to just hang around here & there in searching a good food place with a great environment. Then this is. We have been there consecutively 2 days and tried pizza pasta and french fries. I must say pizza was just delicious. If you can just continue keeping this quality, you will be housefull shortly. Pasta was also good. Cheesy fries wasn't up to the mark I must say. This would be be...tter if you do it by baking in oven. and the flaw I must mention is your service. Waiters are not just accustomed to the typical restaurant service. Try experienced ones. This restaurant will be great place unless you people let the quality be beaten by popularity. :)",4.0,

"The most horrible food i ever had.the mutton torkari was too oily,, piece was small..and the food was not only ordinary bt just totally horrible,i love spice bt it was like the food had no taste ,totally waste of money, Totally Faltu food, rating just 1 out of 10.",1.0,

"Those who loves to have ডাল-ভাত along with spicy beef, mutton or chicken, this is the best restaurant for them ! Chui (চই/চুই), the mighty spice that can make you drool anywhere at any moment ! The beef/mutton/chicken pieces where big enough to fill your tummy ! The pulse and the smashed potato are good too. You can choose your own damn meat and very own piece. The service persons are well behaved. Over all a damn cozy place to have lunch or dinner with your beloved ones. Loved it.",4.0,
"I visited few days back. The overall environment and decoration is very pale and sub-standard. The plastic chairs and dirty tables, unhygienic washroom and basin area ruined my taste for having food. Nevertheless, I ordered for their beef and mutton. Simply, taste was rubbish. The mutton was stale and just served after warming the mutton cooked the other day. Anyway, more was left for me. When wished to try their chicken, I was told that it was finished though it was 9 pm only. The brinjal fry was burnt and was not edible at all. The dal was simply as good as that served in a street shop. And finally, the rice was of such poor quality that I can't even imagine even to serve this quality rice to my domestic servant. OK, I tried their firni also and I don't wanna say any more. A total wastage of my money. Determined not to visit ever.",1.0,
Now the rating is like this because I wasn't able to have food here due to their lack of responsibility. I was planning to go to their Bashundhara branch for sehri and for that I did talk to them a few times to ensure they are open for sehri. Now after going there at 1 AM monday night(Tuesday 1am) I found them closed. When asked they replied they ran out of food that day just after the Iftar and that's why they are closed today. Very unprofessional and hugely disappointing. ... Couldn't you post a note saying that in your FB page!!! What the hell is wrong with you guys!!!,1.0,
"For me it was like tasting the flavour I always liked. It was not like what I used to have in Abbas Hotel or in Satkhira or in Khulna Zero Point but its one of the places where the traditional food of Khulna region can be found here in Dhaka. It made me feel nostalgic. So, I have no complain about the environment or service :)",5.0,

"Worst Experience I have ever had. We almost waited for more than 1 hour only for 2 pasta. It was not well cooked. They don't maintain first order first serve basis. Who ordered after us they got their pasta but we didn't. When we asked that waited told us that 'age jeita Ber hoise sheita serve Kora hoise'. I think waiter should know how to provide service. Then they shout to their cook that 'jemon hoise Ber koro'. Every waiter and specially who wear glass should be more professionalism. Personally I won't go think that restaurant to go twice. I would recommend ""Cafe Appeliano"" which is very good in every way.",1.0,

But do u realize the price it becomes?? Does it match with the food?? Today I had iftar there.. I m deeply disappointed with everything. I had Fried R...ice with three items.. It was the worst set meal I hv ever had. If i analyse it briefly i will say Food Quality- 2*, Quantity- 1* , Price-1* (300/-) (Excluding VAT). It becomes 345/- total (Without water, Soft drink) .. I just wanna say I love ur place.. Please adjust the price with the quantity.. And also U should watch out about the quality. Its really horrible.. Dont be blew away so early..

"After hearing a massive exaggeration about this place, went there for lunch. We wanted to try tacos but they said it's unavailable. Then we asked about nachos but they told us that it can be provided with beef only so finally we ordered Grind House Special Pizza 6 inches and club sandwich! And later...we repented for our decision....the pizza was burnt and tasted too bitter we couldn't even finish half! It was that horrible...and the sandwich was average...you can get that a...t any usual fastfood shop so I had to fill my tummy with two coca colas...moreover the place was too hot.. we asked why they aren't running their air conditioners and they said it's because of load shedding...come on you should take the necessary step to run one ac atleast! They were playing music on high volume so they could have the facility of running atleast one ac during power cut anyways I'm giving one star for their service...it was the only thing I liked about the place...had the wish to taste their Jambola Pasta but after having the pizza I wanted to run as soon as possible...sorry but greatly disappointed after hearing such high reviews OVERHYPED ! ... So... That's my girlfriend's review ... Lol... . xD So I spent 720/- for 2 Coca-Cola & a leftover burnt pizza... OH dear., Thank you.. -_- You are doing great .. Grind House..

What a strategy to inhibit us to order those set menus as they are relatively cheap in price! After that, I gave feedback to their manager and he said that, there's... The Fried rice was very good with a good smell. The diameter of the glasses were so less that it could held no more than 150-200 ml of soft drink. The last devastating and irritating thing was, they proposed us at least 5 times to give review on Facebook about their food! Why man? Isn't it my choice that I like to give review or not?

Now comes to the service. Their service was extremely bad. Food took 1 hour to receive. Never going there again. Beware everyone don't waste your valuable time and money here.,1.0,

Today's experience: I went there after seeing their offer yesterday. lt was valid upto first week of January. But instead they told me they are unable to provide it. I went from mirpur area.

There was the bitterness of the chocolate which I liked. The brownie had a crunchy top and it was chewy overall, loved it. Overall it's okay.

"Disappointing. Brownies did not taste fresh and of the six different types, each one tasted identical to the next - only the actual toppings (KitKat or Oreo etc) are different, so it's a bit misleading to give them completely different names when they are actually the exact same product.

"Visiting from New York I was skeptical about what I ate. I found this place to extremely hygienic. Being a coffee lover I needed a place where I can grab coffee everyday I tried Gloria jeans and many other but this place serves the satisfying cup of coffee, it is a must have. I also recommend trying the Thai soup and the basil leaf I suggest you ask to put chilies in the sauce, it's a to die for combination with the rice that is slightly sweet. If you're looking for a comfy friendly place to have dinner with it even coffee with friends or family I suggest you come here. Super impressed!!!",5.0,

"26/8/2018- Absolute Thai genuine Siamese dishes 5 Stars⭐️ The hot and spicy Tom yam soup with seafood was superb and it was beyond description of mere words...! Thai mango salad with crispy cat-fish was not only pleasing to the eyes but it had teased our tastebuds to the fullest as well...!... Stir-fried sliced beef with vegetables was equally good in both looks and taste...! Last but not least, even the steamed rice was fantastic and we whacked it all till the last grain...! A word of thanks to your great staff who had offered their best and impeccable service during our patronage at your outlet. Keep up the good job and we wish to have the chance to come back for more in the near future.",,True

Totally disappointed seafood soup.,,False
"The worst Thai food ever! I went there five times to prove myself wrong, but the desi chef consistently served us worst possible food every time. First time I went with a friend and we tried a salad, rice noodle with prawn and finally a coconut ice cream. That was by far the acceptable ones, because we could at least finish eating. We have been fed with the lie that a Thai chef is working in the kitchen, whose big picture is proudly displayed at the entrance! From second time... onwards everything went wrong. Called the manager, who says he is looking into it and never returned. We asked the waiters who also disappeared and never came back. It is the third time we found out that their Thai chef has actually gone on leave two months ago, later found out he left four months ago. The current cook is a Bangladeshi who worked in Bangkok for many years. I am sure he never cooked Thai cuisine for Thai people. Probably worked sat ome desi restaurant in Bangkok cooking desi curries and bhartas! He is your so called “Thai” chef currently preparing all the dishes singlehandedly. My God! Last time we went, we ordered a seafood soup in coconut milk and beef Panama curry. The soup was so sweet that we thought we are having coconut milk sherbet! The beef panang curry was also very sweet. My friend and I were so disappointed that we vouched that we will NEVER COME BACK to Absolute Thai. What an absolute cheating! Be aware!",1.0,
"The worst Thai food i have ever had in my life, We order sea food soup, and pad Thai,, Sea food soup was really bad and dont ask about the pad Thai it was horrifying,, Noodels were overcooked, overloaded with sauce, too much sweet, and very raw egg kinda smell.. They told us their chef is from Thailand,... If a Thai chef couldn't cook pad Thai in a right way then who else does!? Maybe that's he couldn't rise up his career in Thailand ���� and came to Bangladesh ��.. The waste of money but our pictures came out really well,, thats the only good thing about this restaurant.��",1.0,
"Items were far less, not everything mentioned in the Iftar+Dinner buffet menu was there. When you are paying 1k++ for buffet and get only 18+ items to choose from you at least expect the taste to be spot on, but the food didn't taste good. They couldn't even get the fried rice right�. They claim to be an authentic Thai restaurant but their Pad Thai was the most disappointing dish out of all- It was noodle stirred in a handful of tomato ketchup and egg�. Also, main and desse...rt items were finished by the time we were done with our appetizer and entree. And the most frustrating part of the dinner was the payment. In their facebook post, they mentioned if you pay through certain bank's card you will enjoy 20% discount. So, I decided to pay with my card, which belonged to one of their mentioned banks, but they gave me only 15% discount. When I let them know about their post, they demanded proof-which I showed them on my phone, but still they were firm and rigid on their claim.",1.0,
I just had the most amazing experience at Absolute Thai the other day. The Seheri platter is absolutely worth the money. You can have 2 platters only at BDT 850++ and the food is really delicious. Really liked the Chicken Satay and the Prawn Tempura. The Mango sticky rice was a bit weird but really yummy. Way to go Absolute Thai. Going to visit you soon again!,5.0,
"The pad thai was basically boiled flat noodle tossed in sauce and scrambled eggs, no bean sprouts or any greens. The mango with sticky rice was horrible with the rice undercooked maybe because the rice was frozen before it was boiled or whatever. Coconut ice cream was ok but too sweet, the only thing good was the tom yam soup but really getting 1 out of 4 dishes taste right is just disappointing.",2.0,
Stylish decor and good food. A must go for food lovers,,True
"It’s been awhile since I’ve last been here. So, we decided to revisit. And man, how I regret it! The pad thai was so bad and so stinky that we decided to send it back. The only two things that were average was, the fried rice and the red chilli beef. Sea food green curry lacked the flavour and was smelly as well. Fishcake was to rubbery, chicken was basically an overdose of soya sauce. They had only one other table with a family of 5/6 along with us 4, yet my wife literally h...ad to shout “excuse me” to call out the waiter, at least 3/4 times. When I asked about if they had discount for credit cards, the waiter said no with a very straight face till I showed him that EBL signature cards are eligible for 15% discount on ala carte. He went to double check and agreed so. The only thing that probably stood out was they didn’t charge us for the pad thai, which we sent back. It’s really sad to see a restaurant doing so good when they open and only in a matter of time everything deteriorates. Not going back unless they give me free tickets to Thailand!!!",1.0,

"Yes i liked the food. But only thing so far i found totally absurd was the price of the local pepsi can which was 75tk 250ml which must not be more than 40tk highest, i myself buy ""imported"" pepsi or coke for 80tk, so for imported 330ml cans if you put the price over 100tk still i don't mind... but i am not bound to pay local 30-35tk cans for 75tk at least. It has nothing to do with service charge or any other expense, so no excuse please. One or two waiters need to know the basics before packing the left over foods as well.",4.0,
"Disappointed � I absolutely (#punintended) love to find faults when I'm at restaurants so that I can bash them on their facebook page.

I was also highly disappointed by their constantly smiling faces. So with great regret I am giving them 5 stars.",5.0,

The PRICES seemed reasonable for 1:3 main dishes, 1:1 appetizers and deserts.",5.0,
"Shocking, We tried earlier it was fabulous, this time with friends of early years tried to enjoy but really felt very much disappointed, other than the fish cake and chicken tempura every dish was below par (even it was cold like local Hotel) and finally the so called noodles had to changed after serving,",1.0,

"Went with a friend for dinner. totally starving after not having had anything to eat the entire day, after shopping. Decided to go for thai food. We arrive around 5ish pm today, there were only 2 tables occupied so of course we expected the service to be fast, but of course that was not the case at all. We ordered thai ice tea, tom yum soup, absolute thai platter, pineapple rice and pad thai. The ice tea too much milk, which ended up really sweet. Tom yum soup was utterly ...disappointing, too much coconut milk. The platter, the only ok, not even good, but ok in it was the fried prawns. The rest was obsolutely rubbish. Pineapple rice was not up to standard at all, the prawn was not fresh at all and the worst of them all which was not even edible and which probably made me and my friend sick was the pad thai, which seemed like it was a left over from yesterday. It had a smell. It was obsolutely rubbish. Worst thai experience i have had. We lost out appetite in the end. We only had a mouthful, paid and left. I felt sick and havent had anything to eat but a chocolate brownie from somewhere else hoping the taste would all be gone and my appetite will get back. But no, my appetite is completely lost. I wouldnt even give this a 1 star! Terrible experience and the service was terrible as well! There were a number of staffs with only 3 tables occupied, including ours however, we had to get up to get the bill as no one came when we called out for anyone! First and last time here. Not worth the time, the food and the money! Dont waste your money! Save the trip! Go somewhere else!",1.0,

Then the item Thai Noodle with Prawn was just like eating plastic and was tasteless as well. This fried rice was OK. But the dessert item coconut ice was too much salty. And Mango sticky rice - you never ever going to pay for this awful food. When we called the manager and asked whether you have changed your cook or not?

"Food was good... we ordered Prawn fried rice, seafood thai soup, beef with pepper and sweet and sour king prawns... apart from the rice (which was ordinary at best), everything else was good... Now the problems... the king prawns isn't really cheap, so one would expect equal sized prawns... but the restaurant does the same trick many other restaurants do, they give 2 actual king prawns and the other 2 is less than half the size.... our total for the food was 2200, which (if i...t was all inclusive) would have been perfect and amazing, and I'd have recommended it to my friends and would have visited again....however, the 15% VAT and 10% service charge took our total bill to closely BDT 3000... upon close calculation, we realised that the 3:1 rice which was 575 BDT would actually cost 718 including the ++ .... paying 718 Tk for 3 person rice feels ridiculous for even a 3 michellin star studded restaurant... similarly, water costs 65++ (BDT 80)... we went on a weekend and it was almost empty.... and I can understand why... despite the restaurant being really nice, not a lot of people would go there more than once... I hope the restaurant management realizes that and does something about it, because I'd love to go there again if the price becomes reasonable...",2.0,

They charged for 10 people and when we went to argue the manager told me "" i have never been to any good restaurant so i don't know how it works , all the good fancy restaurants take money for each reservation"" and also said many disrespectful things. Never been this offended in my ...entire life. Restaurant is not about food it is also about the customer service. It seems the authority only wants one time customer, and want their customers to get insulted by their mannerless staffs. Its not about money it is about disrespect. Never going there ever , nor will suggest anyone to go. They need to be sued. RUBBISH PLACE TASTELESS FOOD",1.0,

"The food tasted good as a whole, but I didn't like the mixed fried rice; to be very specific, it lacked seasoning, and had lumps of rice, which were not stir fried properly; the overdoneness came from the oozing mix of dark soya sauce. The Seafood Tom tum and chicken in coconut milk soups were tasty, but I've definitely tasted better flavoured ones in Dhaka. The prawn cakes tasted like store bought frozen ones, they were quite rubbery, the chicken satays tasted good. Chicken... with cashew nut, beef chilli and Fish with black pepper sauce were good, but nothing to be over-hyped about, as Dhaka has seen a vast number of restaurants serving Authentic Thai cuisine. The interior and service both were pleasant. I personally feel they still have space for improvement in their cooking techniques. Overall it was a good experience, my family was happy at the end of the day, and that's the most important thing.",3.0,

"Just had an Absolute Feast with my family at Absolute Thai! Started off the evening with the Mixed Appetizers which was great while we waited (considering that it was a packed Friday night, it did take time, but also gave us the chance to chat). The food was brilliant, and 3 hours later, I am still full and can barely move. The Coconut soup with Seafood was my personal favourite! Supplemented by the Dim Sum, an item that appeared to be a Thai Fuchka and Thai Fishcakes dipped... in a Creamy Garlic Sauce, it was a great opener. We ordered loads of items but the Pad Thai, Red prawn and the Chicken with Green Curry particularly stood out. We ended the evening with the (sweet) Lemon Grass juice and the infamous Sticky Rice with Mango (which really lived upto its hype). The restaurant itself is cozy, comfortable, illimunaited and has a classy feel without trying hard. This place is a must for anyone looking for fine dining with quality Thai food.",5.0,

I didn't quite get from which angle this was Thai cuisine apart from some Thai spices & vegetation randomly thrown in. And apparently the chef is Thai. Well, I can imagine he was probably found selling Thai mama piaju on the streets of Thailand. Worst Thai food experience.",1.0,

"Entered Spaghetti Jazz at roughly 2.45pm after calling them up to find out if they were open and where exactly the restaurant was. They asked us to order fast as they we gonna stop the kitchen operations at 3pm. We ordered 2 mushroom steaks. They were quick to serve the food. The grilled vegetables were good. Mashed potato was a little dry. Steak was dry and chewy. Mushrooms tasted bland. The waitress kept on hovering around us and handed the bill over to us not even halfway through the meal. She insisted we pay up the bill then mentioning that they were going to go on a break. At no point were the waiters/wiatresses cordial with us. Their attitude was outright impolite. We should have been notified on arrival that they were going to have a soft-close at 3 and wouldn't be able to serve us then. We would have been alright with that and left. Instead, they served us overcooked steaks and provided us the worst service I've experienced since 2013. To the Management: I am sorry but your steak was overpriced considering the quality and you really need to hire new staff. Alternatively you can also remove the service charge from your prices and make your employees work for the tip, who now get it regardless of how they treat your customers. The two stars I have given you is because of the grilled vegetables and the positive attitude of the guard with the beard; the only good things about our experience at SJ today. This is a very constructive criticism, please take note of it.",2.0,

"Probably the best buffet restaurant for dinner in Dhanmondi in terms of food quality and variety, price and ambience with a few small shortcomings that you'd do well to be prepared for. The buffet begins at your table with ""starters"" i.e. the day's bbq served at your table - chicken, fish and mutton with naan, which is refilled as you finish the serving. Although the waiters claim that the starters are ""un-limited"", after you've asked for a refill twice, service slows down an...d the waiters begin to discourage you from asking for more refills by repeatedly telling you that the bbq is only a starter and that you can now try the main buffet. It might get annoying, but as I found out, it's not bad advice since the buffet is quite good. The main dishes aren't the same old buffet dinner fare you see over and over again, but different and tasty. Their chicken biryani, creamy chicken and lemon fish in particular were really good. The chicken soup and chicken basil leaf were a little too salty though. The others - onion prawn, shahi paneer, beef etc were good. Among their deserts, their shahi tukra and brownie were good while the others - bread pudding, firni, fruit etc were just plain. However, they also serve kulfi! It wasn't out of the world, but hey - it's kulfi! Overall, definitely a place I'd recommend for dinner. And if you take my advice - don't try to get all your money's worth from the bbq alone; save it for the buffet, it's worth it. P.S. the menu changes from day to day, and so might your experience there.",4.0,

"It was nice, felt like an overseas buffet restaurant. The built-in BBQ grill table with unlimited kebabs is their main attraction. For starters, they served chicken boti, mutton shish, fish, Indian paneer & potato kebabs. I loved the chicken kebab most, it was well marinated with yogurt and spices. Other than that, they had chicken corn soup, papadums, chutneys & lots of salads. The main course had a rather small but good selection of dishes. The Hyderabadi biryani was nice b...ut the meat wasn't tender enough and it was made from ""mixed cuts"". I also liked the beef chili (bhuna), fish with lemon grass, prawn with tomato & basil and shahi paneer (similar to korma). There were only four dessert items with unlimited kulfi. The buffet price (Tk.1200) doesn't include VAT or any drinks. Overall, it would be better if they could include mutton boti kebab for starters and expand the menu for main course & dessert items.",4.0,

"From the outside it doesn't look much but its a different story once you step inside. Quite well decorated with comfortable sitting arrangements. Went there first time during for Iftar + dinner. The highlights of the menu were the whole lamb, whole fish, lasagna and teriyaki chicken. The lamb was well marinated and soft, while the fish was also equally marinated. The lasagna was exceptionally good specially for a buffet Iftar menu. One other thing which I liked was the live grilling station serving minute steaks, prawns and grilled mackerels. The staff were quite attentive, quickly clearing out our plates during the buffet and checked with us if food was ok or if we need anything else. Hope they can keep up the level of quality and service",5.0,

Wish them all the very best in future.",5.0,
"First thing that i look when i reach an eatery is a parking spot, even though Shaw is located near a very busy exit but their outdoor personnel efficiently managed and secured me a good parking spot. The decor and the ambience is very luxurious but entering the place made me feel awkward as i found the restaurant staffs (waiters) themselves sitting at guest chairs and watching TV. They couches are very cozy to sit but i also think they congested the place with too much sittin...g arrangement. They should have left more free space for free movement even though they have such a big floor. Their food quality is excellent, the steaks were perfectly marinated and cooked to perfect flavors and temperature, the taste and the look shows that dishes are cooked delicately here. However the portion is the issue!! I think the servings are not adequate, even the pictures taken of the food on the plate looks poor. I think the main courses served should have the standard portion Quantity that any other fine dining offers. The Manager was a very nice gentlemen. And the waiter who served us was also very attentive and gentle. Also charging 15Tk only for the bottled water was cool !!",4.0,

"Went there with high expectation. The appetiser was okay but the main dishes were pathetic. There was some smell coming out from the steak and didn’t like the flavour at all. Also we complained about it to the manager and he gave us complementary desserts which also tasted smelly. The presentation was good, service was good but sadly the food taste was not up to the mark. It is an expensive food place so it is normal for customer like us to expect that high quality and value for money we are paying. Hope they will improve and give us the chance to say something good in the future!",1.0,

"Shaw’s Steakhouse in Dhaka is located in Gulshan 2, however is a major let down. First I wanted to go there for a dinner on the day before EID, since they had a promotion (discount plus free drink). I contacted the restaurant and confirmed that they are open. Unfortunately I went there then accordingly only to discover that the restaurant had closed already at 7.00 p.m. without prior notice. Nevertheless I agreed to give it a second try and went there once more today, only to... be even more disappointed. What I noticed immediately was that the restaurant was extremly empty, that though might have been to the early time of the day (7.45 p.m.). I would have loved to eat several of their items on the menu, but to my disappointment the majority of their items were unavailable. The issue started small, first one starter wasn’t available and we asked for some more time to re-think alternatives. Shockingly the issue of them being out of items continued, for the next 7 (starters, salds, steaks, pasta dishes,… !!) items we wanted to order each time as an alternative. They each time said that the item would be unavailable or that they had run out of stock (for example Beef nachos was apparently already sold out). . but at 7.45 p.m. and only two other customers at the restaurant that seemed to be highly unlikely.. ironically enough they later tried to suggest that we take one of their more expensive platters which contained 4 of the items that they had told us before would be unavailable and rest only the most expensive items were available from the menu. It is evident to me that the restaurant which had a decent amount of potential is just being run-down and not properly managed and that must be the reason why there are no or hardly any customers… (despite their social media presence being very professional).",,False

The burger we ordered was cowboy and it was as cold as ice.

They didn’t even apologize to us for their service. It didn’t happen only with us many others said the same thing. The shop was full of complaints not foods. Yuck.

I saw a boy coming with ...a plate having rice and a small piece of chicken no salad and no chinese vegetable!!! I wondered when I asked why its like this he said that vegetables are not available. the worst thing is when I told that I bought a guest with me why u guys insulting me.The waiter told me to manage..Waiters don't have slightest concern for customers. They just move around they don't care at all and the person who took the order he was mad about to go home and when looking for him to answer he was not there already left.who was in cash he took full bill and even did not ask me anything.Awfully he asked extra money for drinks.I never imagined take a bite is giving this worst service now a days.

Now the quantity is twice lesser than before and time of delivery has gone up twice too! You were so good before!,2.0,

"Hands down, worst pasta I've ever eaten. I'd go one step further and say It's probably the worst fast food I've eaten ever. Pizzas found in Cha Birir tong with a price tag of 25 taka taste much better than this. I ordered a naga baked pasta. It had 70% rubber, 29.99% oil and 0.01% chicken. Not even a single molecule of cheese. Literally there was nothing that can resemble anything close to cheese. There were in total 3 microscopic pieces of chicken. Taste: 0/10... Price: -inf / 10 ( I was charged 239 taka for this piece of crap. ) I get that it can be hectic before iftar and quality of some items might fall. But what I was delivered, was simply garbage.

Went there for the first and last time. Environment 0/10. Old tables and polishes were coming off. AC was turned off. Service 2/10: staffs were not friendly and they don't seem to care about the customers Food 3/10: ordered naga pasta and naga chow mein. The pasta was the worse pasta I've ever eaten and it didn't have no spice and it was nowhere near to be called naga pasta . Took it as parcel as it was tasteless. After going home it was a rotten as they surely served bashi pasta. Giving 3 star rating because chow mein was a bit up to the mark. Horrible experience. Will never ever go there again.,,False

"Went to Pasta State Dhanmondi to have unlimited Pasta.... I had buffet and Unlimited meals at least 30-40 times in the last few years but this wast the worst unlimited offer.... Here's a short review~ So when I was entering the restaurant a guy was going out , he came back 1 minute after that and complained that a cockroach came out from his Pizza Box � I saw the cockroach too.... Kinda lost my appetite there... They probably changed his pizza after that. After that we were w...aiting and the electricity went off, The whole restaurant was for at least 15 minutes so I am guessing they don't have a generator. Finally they served the pastas 20 minutes before Iftar... it was looking good to be honest... So after azan we started eating and the next experience is horrible... There was only cheese top layer... they just mixed mayonnaise with some boiled pasta and topped it with a lil bit of cheese and served it... At least 1/5th part of the bowl was full of oil � I ate 20 huges slices of pizza in another restaurant last week so eating 5/6 bowls or atleast 3 bowls of Pasta is nothing for me... My friend didn't even try another bowl... I went for a second one and they said they don't have any more bowls to serve the pastas so they started serving in take away containers.... Btw ALL of the plates and bowls were broken (the edges) I couldn't even finish the second one... so I requested a waiter to pack it up for me so I can give it to someone on the street since it's Ramadan we shouldn't waste food � They packed it up.... Almost everyone took their pasta in parcel because they couldn't finish it... (though it was an unlimited offer) They are serving their ""Special Baked Pasta"" only with Coke/Sprite~ Price : 345tk (including everything) Taste : 2/10 � Environment : 5/10 Service : 5/10 I won't even recommend my enemy to go and take this order � Really disappointed~",1.0,

"My student was asking me for the past year to meet up with him near his old house. I just couldn't make any time, until today. :( :) I looked up the food places near Taj Mohol road, Dhaka on Google maps, and it was the same old same old, BFC/KFC/Pizza Hut BS. I didn't want to go to any of them. I wanted to try some place new. As I kept searching a little marker stood in one far north-west corner of the map. It read Bell Pattio. I called my student and we met up nearby, only t...o be greeted by an exhausted employee in a small lone, gloomy room of a restaurant. I wondered all the time whether they actually served anything at all. The exhausted employee asked us if we wanted the works, to which we simply replied ""sure"". The Pizza arrived in 10min. It was the fastest pizza order I ever received in town. And it was superb! I recommend all to come here at least once if not more, in their lifetime. 5/5",5.0,
"They sell sausage pizza in all their varieties... Filmy cafe sell their Pizzas by changing the name and price. I used to buy a lot from them, see my previous comments at this page...

"My friend and I wanted to try this place after seeing a review on Instagram. It was a little difficult to find since neither of us had been to Shakhertak. We ordered a Meat Lovers Supreme. The pizza arrived in 15-18 mins, piping hot. It was the kind of pizza one would find at a restaurant like Pizza Hut, which was a pleasant surprise. It does say ""Beef and Chicken"" in the pizza description but they came in sausage form and not their usual form. This was a bit unusual but not a bad idea. The dough was fresh, there was a good amount of cheese, the service was good, and the price was very very reasonable. I hope they continue doing what they're doing because it's working. I hope to visit them once again soon.",4.0,

Pizza not as described in the menu. I ordered two different pizzas. Surprisingly both looked and tasted the same. :/ They used the local Dhaka cheese instead of Mozzarella on the crust. Very minimal amount of beef/chicken on the crust. Dough got hard even when it was warm. I needed to heat it twice in the oven to eat. Never ever ordering from them again.,1.0,

"Chicken Steak with Rice (This offer is not available now) Price : 239 + vat Although this offer is not available now I am posting this if it again pops up. The food was indeed what was shown on the promo photo by Bunkers Khilgaon. Mostly the place was humble enough to let us celebrate our friend's birthday. The hospitality we got was indeed astonishing. So if you guys are finding it hard to get a decent place to have some quality time with your friends and family. I would re...ally recommend you Bunkers �. Pasta Basta Price : 350 + vat It was another meal I had there. One of the best pasta basta in khilgaon I ever had. The two layer pasta was full of chicken and beef. If you are a pasta fan I would really ssuggest you to go there and try this. Lastly we went up there without any previous reservation, so if you guys are planning on going there please do call them or inbox them before you go there.",5.0,
Definitely a place to hangout with your friends and family. Good quality food with affordable price range on the menu. Supported by great service by the staff.,5.0,
"Worst service.. They had only three tables to cover.. They somehow managed that to look like a rush.. Took more than one hour to serve simple oven baked pasta which by the way was blunt and creamy. The chicken steak oregano tasted good but the quantity and the price don't match at all. Set menu was average with very unpleasant decoration.. But coming back to my first point, if you guys can't serve anything within a given time please do have the decency to accept it and tell us on the face. People who came late and ordered late got their foods served but others had to wait for no apparent reason ! Customers don't want 10% honour or whatsoever for your lousy service.. Never going back to your place and obviously not recommending it to others.. but then again with so many customers in your grasp a lousy review doesn't matter anyway.",2.0,

This is the worst restaurant in Taltola. I don't know how on earth they dared to serve customers like this way. Their waiters are really manner less. We had to wait for a long time to get the foods served. I don't know how they got 116 Five Star reviews here. I am pretty sure that all of them are owners closest ones. This restaurant should be avoided if you don't your money to get wasted on such tasteless food & rubbish service. Never going there again. :( :( :( � �,1.0,

"During last Saturday, I had Iftar cum dinner buffet at Bunkers. So guys, I am reviewing on the basis of only this; do not relate this with any of their regular platters. I had only tasted what was offered in that buffet menu. THE WORST BUFFET EVER I EXPERIENCED !!!... I am not writing this on anger. I let myself cool down, waited for than two days and were thinking where that went wrong; now reviewing. 1. If a restaurant offers buffet, it should be only buffet. No other regular platter should be offered during that time span. That creates a mess. They were offering buffet with every other regular platters. Hence, there place wasn't well designed and stuffs were not properly trained to handle such mayhem. 2. They offered around 30 items and to refill one dish we had to wait like 10 to 15 minutes; standing in a line. If you don't have enough structural setup and expertise to handle a house full of guests, why you guys offer buffet? 3. There were shortage of food. Usually people have spring roll with soup. They were refilling soup but spring roll was vanished; literally vanish after first round. When I asked, they replied (শেষ হয়ে গেসে ভাইয়া, সরি). What nonsense is that? Do you guys even know what buffet means? 4. And there was an item of chicken covered with sauce (I forgot the name). That was good. I could grab 3 pieces and yet again, never refilled. According to their menu, they should have an item of beef, haven't seen it. A guest from the next table said that they gave a new dish, spicy chicken; I went and an empty plate was there. I complained and probably the store manager said (স্যার, দিয়ে তো কুলাতে পারছি না, দেয়ার সাথে সাথেই শেষ হয়ে যাচ্ছে). Dear that person, let me apologize for my language, but are you stupid? Do the math. Count the number of ovens you have, number of cooks in there, stuffs you have, estimate your food preparation pace, understand how many guests you can handle and over buffet for 5 less than that number. If you cannot cope up with the pace even once, you should be really really sorry. 5. And, now comes the topic of mighty PIZZA. Pizza wasn't included in the buffet menu they showed me but they were offering it. WORLD'S THINNEST PIZZA, I MUST SAY! :P Everyone must go and have a look; really astonishing. 6. Buffet time was till 9PM and most of the dishes were vanished around 7.45PM. People were starting to leave and around 8PM I left with the worst buffet experience in my life.",1.0,

"Last Friday we planned to dine out and headed to Pizza Hut at Dampara, Chittagong. We ordered for a large size cheesy bite pizza with chicken & other expected toppings, baked chicken pasta, fried button mushroom and cream of chicken soup. We were really shocked to find just a few tiny chunks of chicken as part of the toppings over the so-called pizza. Cream of chicken soup was also nothing special. By pouring little cream on a typical glutinous soup, you can't name it cream o...f chicken soup for your very kind information. Trust me, I had much better baked pasta at Da Signature in Chittagong and Shawarma House in Dhaka. Your baked pasta was awefully gravy when the cheese layer was taken off the top. Are you guys making money in Bangladesh by fooling innocent hard-working people down here? Are you ripping us off by using the brand ""Pizza Hut""?",1.0,
"Ordered two medium pizzas with extra cheese on both of them. Got one perfectly cut pizza with cheese on top of it and other one with no extra cheese and cut unevenly. Moreover, both of them were cold. Why is your delivery service so poor?",,True
"I order almost 2-3 times a week from Pizza Hut PHD Dhanmondi. I order pizza all the time but unfortunately I ordered the chicken mushroom pasta today which happens to be the worst pasta I ever had. No trace of white sauce, the use of slightly roasted onions was so much that it made me wonder if the main ingredient was pasta or onion. You guys just packed me a box full of garbage! Picture in the comment section!",1.0,

"Pizza hut is a international chain restaurant. But in Bangladesh I don’t think it’s official anymore, because the service, food and environment wasn’t like that what it is used to be 5 years back.

"Good God! After enjoying meals in Pizza hut across the world all my life, I took my boy out during the school break for a treat. He ordered the ""special"" pizza... which turned out to be nothing remotely like what we're used to. Listen, seriously, I know this is Bangladesh and all and you're trying to cater to the native palate but **you don't have to**... pizza hut is now off our list of places (for me and my wife and my son - hat-trick - perfect) because of this monstrosity they served us. If I wanted a Bengali pizza from an American chain (on home ground), I'd head down to my local Habib Hotel and order their curry and rice. It was hideous. The product development team need to stick up a reminder on their desks, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"" Meanwhile, I shall be taking my wallet somewhere where I get a pizza when I order one.",1.0,

"To the authority, I have been a dedicated customer of Pizza Hut for more than 5 years. Your pizzas and service has always intrigued me.

Another case: BDT 104/- VAT+Appl SD for a meal worth BDT 699/- I want to know the reason behind this increase.

I used to keep on calling for attendees, keep asking for services but it took a lot of time to seek their attention. For payment they took my card and no one returned it back. I had to rush to other waiters to find out my cards. Then managers had to come to sort out problems. I had never faced such service. Very heartbroken with the carelessness. Also the taste of food changed drastically. I really don't know is there any reason left I will ever visit there. very much disappointing.",,False

So time ran out and our bus was leaving, so we hurriedly went for the bus and asked them to cancel the order. Our bus started and we were upset that pizza hut couldn’t provide our food.

Simply marvellous their efforts to satisfy their customers. On 9th April I ordered a triple chicken stuffed crust pizza and got dissapointed.

Anyways, next Time I called, they told me that they can't delivery to Jigatola. Was surprised! I told him that I ordered from my present address before. He said it's impossible to deliver to... my address and hung up!

A big and super no no. No matter whatever the hell this is this is not a 9 inch pizza. I specifically asked for spicy and salty and Capsicum there is nothing called these things in an order.

But you better write my address down somewhere and memorize it because I'm ordering again haha. Generous quantity of meat. Amazingly made. Sausages and Pepperonis were tender enough. Perfect crust. On just a small note I do think the onions are kind of a little turn off, but not much big of a deal. And the MiCasa sauce could be just a little less watery, but then again didn't keep me out. Money well spent. Keep this up and in no time you could be amongst the top pizzas in town. Edit: Order was delivered 20 minutes earlier than given time. Amazing punctuality. (Y)",5.0,

"লোভে পাপ, পাপে মৃত্যু !! লোভের বশে ধানমণ্ডির Impasto নামক একটা ক্যাফেতে যাই ১২৯০ টাকায় সারা দুনিয়া খেয়ে উড়ায় দিবো এই ভেবে! কিন্তু এদের খাবার খেয়ে মনে হইছে এরচেয়ে টাকা দিয়ে মাটি কিনে খাওয়াও ভালো ছিলো! এদের সার্ভিস শুধু স্লো না, ভাবখানা এমন - অর্ডার করার পর এরা বাজারে যায় রান্নার জিনিস পাতি কিনতে! ধৈর্য শক্তি রবার্ট ব্রুসের মত না হলে এইখানে না যাওয়াই উত্তম। আর খাবার আসতে যেহেতু ভয়ঙ্কর লেট হয়, তাই পর্যাপ্ত পরিমান খাবার, গুর,মুড়ি,ছোলা, চিড়া, খাবার স্যালাইন, পর্যাপ্ত পানি, পেট খা... এইবার আসি ওদের মাথা নস্ট অফারের খাবার গুলোতে! প্রথমেই দিয়ে গেলো তেল চটচটা বাসি,পুরাতন, ভকভক করে তেলের গন্ধ আসা অতি অখাদ্য পর্যায়ের ফ্রেঞ্চ ফ্রাই! ‘লেতলেতা’ ওয়ার্ড টা বাংলা ভাষায় আর কোন কিছুর সাথে ইউজ করতে না পারলেও ওদের ফ্রেঞ্চ ফ্রাই এর সাথে এই ওয়ার্ড টা দিব্বি যায়! দুই পিস মুখে দিয়ে হাসি মুখে বললাম – খুব অসাধারন খেতে! প্লিজ নিয়ে যান এটা। আপনারা খান।’ চিকেন উইংস নামে একটা নোংরা জিনিস আমার টেবিলে আসলো এরপর! একটা ভালো খাবারকে কিভাবে অখাদ্য বানানো যায় এই বিষয়ে তাদের পি এইচ ডি আছে নির্ঘাত! চিকেন উইংস এর সাথে পচা গলা কিছু নাড়িভুঁড়িও ফ্রি পেলাম! হাইজিন বিষয়ে অজ্ঞতার কারনে এটা হয়ে থাকতে পারে! সস যেটা দিছে ওইটা টোমেটর কিনা জানি না! উপরে লাল রঙ ভেসে থাকতে দেখে খাওয়ার রুচি হলো না। খাওয়ার অযোগ্য এই সস দিয়ে বড় জোড় বাংলা সিনেমায় গুলি খাওয়া নায়কের রক্তাক্ত বুকের দৃশ্য ধারন করা যেতে পারে! এরপর আসলো কোক! দেওয়ার কথা এক লিটারের বোতল! বাস্তবে নিয়ে আসলো দুই গ্লাস কোক! তাও আবার পানি দেওয়া! আপনি ভাবতে পারেন বিষয়টা? হাফ গ্লাস কোকে হাফ গ্লাস পানি ঢালার পরও কোকের টেস্ট এতো বাজে হয় কিনা জানি না! এতক্ষন চুপ করে ছিলাম! এরপর আর রি-এক্ট না করে পারলাম না! অলরেডি তখন আশে পাশের টেবিলের লোকজন টেবিল ছেড়ে উঠে কমপ্লেইন এর পর কমপ্লেইন করে ভাসিয়ে ফেলছে! পিছনের টেবিলের এক ভাইয়া আপু খাবার না খেয়েই রাগ করে উঠে গেলেন বিল দিতে! যাই হোক সবশেষে দিয়ে গেলো পিজা! পর্যাপ্ত পরিমান চিনি দিয়ে মিষ্টি করা কিউট বার বি কিউ পিজা এতো সুইট কেনো জানতে চাইলে ওরা বলল যে বার বি কিউ পিজা নাকি মিষ্টি হয়! আমি সব শুনে বললাম ‘ও আচ্ছা!’ এই জিনিস ওইখানে বসে খাবার উপায় ছিলো না। বললাম ভাই পিজা গুলা প্যাক করে দেন! উনারা সুন্দর মত কোন বক্সে না দিয়ে বাজারের আলু মুলা যেসব ব্যাগে ঝুলিয়ে আনে ওই ক্যাটাগরির একটা ব্যাগে এক্ টার উপর আরেকটা ফেলে জগা খিচুরি বানিয়ে হাতে ধরায় দিলো! Now the question comes! Who cares for my money ?? Consumer satisfaction বলে একটা মার্কেটিং টার্ম আছে যেটা চটকদার ভুগি চুগি বিজ্ঞাপন থেকে অনেক ভালো কাজ করে। নাইলে স্টার কাবাব , নান্নার বিরিয়ানির মত দোকান গুলো কোন রকম বিজ্ঞাপন ছাড়া টিকে থাকতে পারতো না! Impasto কে ম্যানশন করে বলছি! ভাই চটকদার বিজ্ঞাপনের ফাঁদে আমাদের মত হাবাগোবা কাস্টমারদের একদিনের জন্য বলদ বানিয়ে কয় টাকার বিজনেস করবেন? এরচেয়ে এইসব বিজ্ঞাপনে পয়সা ওয়েস্ট না করে Consumer Satisfaction কে মার্কেটিং এর পুঁজি বানান। দেখবেন একটা সাথে দশটা জিনিস ফ্রি দিয়ে কাস্টমার ধরতে হচ্ছে না, এম্নিতেই দোকানে লাইন পরে যাবে! Finally, I wish Impasto guys will take a lesson out of the post. They should take the criticism sportingly to overcome their limitations. Good Luck!",,False

আমাদের প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনা জীবনে ওনেক কস্ট করেছে যখন তার পরিবারকে হত্যা করেছে। একা পথ চলেছে। যার বাবা ছিলনা সেই বুঝে তার কস্ট।তবুও সেই হার মানে নাই।বাংলাদেশের কোটি মানুষের পাসে এসে দারান।তবুও তার পথে কম বাদা আসেনি আবার আসলো 21 আগস্ট গ্রেনেড হামলা।তবুও সেই হার মানে নাই। বাংলা দেশের কোটি মানুষের পাসে এসে দারান।আমরা কখোন প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার কথা চিন্তা করেছি।আমাদের উচিত বাংলাদেশের পতিটি মানুষ তার পাসে দারানো এবং নৌকা মারকা ভোট দিন,5.0,

"Very POOR experience we had on 21st July'17. Had been several times there but food taste gone down, very ordinary hotel can cook better than these. Takes time to refill. Very warm atmosphere (how can you enjoy dinner while u sweat?) Very bad customer service - u have to wait for unlimited time if u ask for something. Some of us waited 10 min for spoon, I had to ask 5 times to serve drinks and got after 15 min when we all done eating!! Manager challenged us at the time of bill... and didnt learn how to deal/talk to customers/guests- we had a guest below 10 years who is supposed to get 50% billed but Manager claims she is around 12 years old. (how mean! -in that case shall we keep birth certificate?) Overall experience is very bad! > Food - 1/5 > Environment - 0/5 > Service - 1/5 (if u cant manage the crowd/customers/food/restaurant, better u close it!)",1.0,

"Our experience was pretty bad. They seemed new. Most of the foods in their menu were unavailable. They even gave excuses like ""our fridges were down, so we can't prepare the milkshakes"". The staffs took order from us 5 times as anything we ordered was unavailable, as they went on asking the chefs I think. Finally we managed to order something. Then they kept us waiting for too long time. They even forgot half of our order. Also we ordered wrapped swarma and they claimed we ordered arabian swarma. This type of hazardous experience we had. Quality and quantity does not meet up to the pricing. Food is very much over priced. Moreover place is cozy and uncomfortable. They were not professional at all. I'd not recommend this place.",1.0,

"The service was really bad. The waiters were rude. Apparently the platters are limited, so we could only order platter 1. They served with missing ingredients. After calling them a million times, they came and added the missing ingredients. Also, the platter says 3 dates but they provided only 1. Not that it matters, but at least don't mention the quantity if you can't deliver. The vegetable and the Dory fish batter had hair. We were so pissed off and there was no time to change, so we just didn't bother to let them know or anything. The food was mediocre. Nothing exceptional. The service and the hair made the experience worse. Highly disappointed. We are paying for good service and good food. The least they can do is not serve unhygienic food and be nice to us.",1.0,

"We went at around 1 pm, and a little later the waiter told us the food would be around 20 minutes late. This was supposed to be brunch, so we asked them to serve us some food which would come fast, while we waited for the rest. They told us the prawn dim sum would be served in 5 minutes, but it came 20 minutes later. After an hour and half, around 2:30pm, we still hadn't been served anything else! We told the manager that we'll only take any food which they could serve by 2:30, but they failed to serve us our orders even by then. We paid for the dim sums and left ravenously hungry, with no apologies from the manager. Apparently there was some owner's brunch which caused this unacceptable delay! Worst service ever.",1.0,

"I love Chow's dumplings but the price I pay for includes food n service both. We went for a friend's birthday last month n ordered the lamb from the main course (as I had it before n I liked it). I put a piece in my mouth and found the lamb totally cold. My friend thought that the dish has to be served cold but as I mentioned that I had it before. So, I called the waiter n told him about it. He took away the dish right then and came back with explanation - ""the chef went out ...of the kitchen so the other person in charge prepared the dish and he forgot that he didn't warm it."" We are paying this price to have refrigerated food??? The manager came to say sorry n served us complementary brownie but how can it replace the fact that they serve cold food from the refrigerator. I have never seen the management write a reply to any of the reviewer so I wonder, does it really make any difference to them?",1.0,
wow food is very good.And they are service is nice.we are comfortable.thanx all the members..,,True
horrible....price wasn't justified with the quantity of food..so was the taste �...and really dissappointed.,1.0,
Let's get one thing clear. A restaurant like Chows has two things to offer. Cuisine and service. Food is great. Proportions are not. Service not good at all. They'll take orders only to return about it's unavailability or the excuse of how difficult it would be to serve hot n sour soup as they're backedup at the kitchen. One garcon even took my dinner plate along with cutleries thinking that i'm done eating. I thought he's giving me a fresh plate after i tried their delicious flash fried whole fish. But I was mistaken :) Great chef. Poor service.,3.0,
"I was impressed by the decor but was disappointed soon by the food. Food is overpriced and bland. The quantity of each item was very small compared to its high price.I had better dumplings in Dhaka. The chowmein was chewy, leathery and cold. I didn't find any Cantonese flavour in any dish. Even the iced tea was very bitter. The service was very slow and poor. I didn't expect such poor service and bad food from a high-end restaurant like Chows.",1.0,
"A complete disappointment, most of the food we ordered was left uneaten as it tasted stale and unappetizing , the prawns we ordered tasted mushy and had a funky flavor, as did their whole fried fish and fried rice, not at all what you'd expect from a premium establishment. Do not recommend and definitely won't be coming back.",1.0,
"Ambiance is perfect for any hangout. Interior is beautiful & serene. Food is also awesome.. The prawn har gow, chicken sui mai, chicken chilly with black bean sauce.. Though the beef item that we ordered could not stand up to our expectations. But overall it was a nice place to spend time with near & dear ones with delicious food added.",5.0,
"Was extremely disappointed with the service yesterday. We went there for brunch and waited for nearly 1.5 hours and yet the food was not served. Whenever we inquired about the order, they kept insisting that the food would be out in 10-15 minutes. Eventually we got up and left. The staff needs to be given a training on customer service (try getting a crash course from the staff at Izumi)!",1.0,
Salt is a major concern. All the dishes that we had it was salty. Decor and service we're excellent. We reserved the private room.,3.0,
Well the food was good as usual. But a bit disappointed on the buffet offering during iftar. I thought the menu would be eat as much as you can but i was surprised with the appetiser being served once as set menu and buffet dinner on the five mains. Come on chows your edm for the offer was misleading,3.0,
"I made a reservation for four at 2:30 pm yesterday. I was there on time, however, my friends had reached a few minutes prior to 3:00 pm. Before they could make themselves comfortable, a waiter insisted that we order at once, since apparently their kitchen closes at 3:00 pm. We did, and waited for 40 minutes (which they asked from us) for our food. Immediately after we finished, our waiter had gotten us the bill before we even asked, and said that they were to have a staff pa...rty- an implication that we leave. The food was good, but not out of the world. Therefore, from such a high-end restaurant, service at-least is well desired from a customer's end. Provided the place would be overcrowded (or even close to being crowded) on the occasion of Pohela Boishakh, I would have understood. I'm afraid that many other reviews well portray how they tend to serve their customers.",2.0,
By far The best Chinese in town. Food is excellent and so is the ambience & service. No wonder why the elites and diplomats living around patronise it so highly both at lunch and dinner. However prices of items in recent months have been jacked up. But then in a premium eatery one has to pay premium rates I guess.,5.0,

"After all the reviews about their service being not up to mark, i was a bit skeptical. But i was really surprised to find their service top of the line. They were very humble and veryyy nice. every person who came to our table and served us food had a big smile and they really do make u feel good about ordering and eating there. The food was just next level. My friends finished most of the appetizers by the time i was there but the 1s i did get to try were mind blowing. also ...their sauces are out of this world (especially this black bean sauce). i do not remember the name of the items but we had a fish a beef a chicken and noodles. each of them were perfect in their own way although i thought the noodles cud improve a wee bit. the fish (fish with black beans think) was the best. we all thoroughly loved the meal but my friends kept saying the appetizers (which i misssed) were better than the main course. Overall it was a great experience. i simply loved it. oh and the place is gorgeous and very well maintained. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",5.0,

"Had a dinner reservation for 3 and after reading several of the reviews on the page and suggestions from family and friends, decided to have a Dim Sum night. Placed 6 orders of various Dim Sums. The first one to arrive was the Steamed Spicy Glass Noodle Dumplings which were average, not my preference. I was quite taken away by the Steamed Mushroom and Herb Dumplings, sort of reminded me of the mushroom momos from Crepe o Momo. That's the end of vegetarian dishes and now my fa...vorite, the meat dim sums. The Chicken and Prawn Sui Mai were tasty, a little hot and would order again. The Beef Cheung Fung looked tastier than it really was. A friend described the taste as a savoury lychee. On the other hand the Crispy Prawn Cheung Fung was the highlight of the night and ended up ordering two of those. The last order was a Prawn and Water Chestnut Dumplings which I devoured with complete satisfaction. At the end of the night, I was full and content. To accompany the dim sum was still water, and service was normal, nothing extraordinary. Overall good dining experience, loved the decor and would visit again.",3.0,

we went to Chow following much hype regarding the food and so forth. Unfortunately turns out as following (1) waiters are very poorly trained regarding assistance during placing order and also hearing out on table preference. (2) food is not of much good/better taste then of recently opened other similar restaurants (3) Waiter's advice on the portions were HORRIBLE Highly discourage visits to Chow not only for the service but also for the taste of food.,2.0,
"Going through your Facebook page, nowhere does it say that you have to make prior reservations. My husband and I went to Chows on Friday night, and we were literally turned out because we had no reservations! I see from one of your reviews that another customer had the same complaint. This level of customer service is unacceptable! As a regular food connoisseur, I'd suggest that you teach your staff customer relations because no amount of glitz and glamour will get you loyal customers if your restaurant has abominable customer service!!!",1.0,

I made a reservation at Chows and went their with my foreign guests. Went I called them to reserve a table they told me that the last order was at 3pm however they will consider my foreign guests and still serve us lunch after hours. When I went there with my guests they literally shut the door on our face and refused us to enter the restaurant. They should have never accepted our reservation if they were unable to serve. They don't have basic human decency. I even told them ...that my Chinese guests would just like to look around even if they cant serve us lunch. Still they shut the door on our faces. How can they be so rude to customers when they will have no business without us. I sincerely advice them to learn how to operate a restaurant and teach their staff basic manners. There are number of Chinese restaurants in Dhaka so don't think that your restaurant is any special.,1.0,

And then after 5 minutes gave us the same thing again. When we complained again they admitting that the seasoning was probably bad. Worst of all, they billed us for it! What the heck??!!

Went there for lunch today: Environment is so so. Sitting arrangement as well as sits are not comfortable at all. Don't know who are their target customers. Ordered set menu 2 for four. Food was ok type. But prawn pad thai was the worst. It was crap. The chef/cook has basic problem of cooking process of Pad Thai. He needs trainig. Initially pad thai (rice noodles) was boiled in less amount of water. So it's got sticky. And not stir-fried. In addition amount of fried rice was not good enough for 4 person. Overall rating is 2 out of 5.,2.0,

Most of the food was inedible, however they didtry to fix the beef dish but the result was just weird tasting sugary over salted beef.",1.0,
Just came back from Rice and Noodle. We went after your great Ramadan reviews so naturally had high expectations. Both our Prawn Pad Thai bowls had guess what JUST ONE prawn in it The Chicken Chowmein was clearly made of Cocola noodles and sadly our maid can make a better noodle dish.

"Tokyo Express is my go to place for Japanese Food - the Ambience is great, the staff is friendly & cooperative - Food has always been excellent - I love their Sushi, Maki roll, Crab salad, Bento boxes & Chillers - however a few more alternatives / options/ variations in the Bento box would be really nice - the only diwnside is the restroom - it needs to be redecorated & kept clean as it's dirty & not maintained",4.0,
"I've been a huge fan of this place since it opened doors a few years back in Banani..however my recent experience has not been too well..i was served stale 'tokyo fried rice'..i was disappointed that they even served it..i had eaten half of the rice, and they later replaced it..but i was through with dinner, so didnt need the replaced rice..its just a disappointment that after a while people start compromising with quality once they get established. kindly address this issue, and try not to compromise with the standards which YOU have set yourself!!",,False
"The people of Tokyo Express have turned to thievery these days. It was bad enough that the service has gone to hell and that the food portions have decreased in size, they have also turned to stealing your food. Went there today with the family and there was a lot of food left over so we asked them to pack it for us. Got home and saw that all the left over sushi was not there. They didn't pack it. Packed everything else but the sushi. Really disgusting to think that they either ate it or they were going to serve it to the next customer. Really appalling Tokyo Express.",1.0,

"I lived japan two years. That time i was falling in love for Sushi. Every weekend I ate lot of sushi. Last year i came back to bd, and thought in my entire life i will not eat sushi as good as sushi meijin in japan. But I was surprised to eat shamon sushi in Tokyo express, that was exactly same taste like sushi meijin in japan. But honestly speaking it is too expensive than japan, whereas japan was one of the most expensive country in the world, Thier food cost, labour cost is too high. But In bd why sushi price is too expensive compare to rice and beef sysling I don't understand. Whatever the sushi was too good. I am so happy to have it.",4.0,

At that time we r taking pictures they told us nothing bt turned off lights ac even also closed the door..just got shocked by their behavior.what kind of bad Manner is this??

"Worst ever experience of dining out at Tokyo Express in Gulshan! With high expectations I took my daughters to have dinner tonight there.I wish I never had gone there . I have tried almost all of the renowned restaurants in Dhaka but this was a nightmare.The service is horribly bad, food came late beyond one can expect Finally when it came, the main dish we crazed for never arrived. We just waited to see what was happening.It wasn't served till the last! Amazingly when the bi...ll came, we were charged also for the dish we never had. The person serving was most inexperienced, ill mannered & paid no attention to our needs. We don't eat free, we pay a lot of money for eating out. I will also complain to the CAB for such managements! The owners of Tokyo express should be more careful in providing services to their customers . I shall never ever go to this place and would highly recommend everyone to think not twice but many many times before going to this restaurant. I had terrible experience tonight ! Thanks to Tokyo express!!!!!",1.0,

"Loved the classic bento! Specially the crispy chicken with white sauce (forgot its name :P ) and the sushi which comes in the bento. Al Hamdulillah. I hate wasabi, I almost choked! The watermelon juice saved my life. :( I personally didn't like the teriyaki tofu, but my family members loved it. It would have been better if it was deep fried and then cook with teriyaki sauce. Just my preference. Anyways, overall experience was good apart form this. The service was amazing. Thank you Tokyo Express <3",4.0,
I ordered take away Firstly this afternoon before Juma I try to order 2 classic bento box They said come after 2pm Than we can serve you Only after Juma... I came all the way from Dhanmondi I placed my order again over the phone They confirmed that come in 10mts It will be ready But when I reached and settled my bill Now they ask me to wait for 10 to 15mts This means they are placing my order now I don't understand why they committed the time line And being so regular and loyal to Tokyo Express This service is unbearable Management put ears to the complaint Otherwise you will be history Service and Timing matters .......

"Tokyo has been one of my very very few favorite places from the time they started but what i have tasted recently has left me utterly disappointed. Firstly the rice, tokyo's fried rice tasted amazing itself but the rice tastes like ""norom bhaat"" i even found few ""shada bhaat er dola"" did you change the rice or something because the rice tastes plain disgusting now! second, the spicy osaka beef tastes rubbery and seems like the only thing used to cook the beef was soy sauce and nothing else. The nanban doesnt even taste the same. the jumbo prawn tempura was the only saving grace! i really hope the management looks into this! this is extremely disheartening for a loyal customer of yours such as me.",2.0,

"Was expecting a great service; after getting recommendation from quite a few friends. Shortage of Miso soup (really? In a Japanese restaurant? REALLY?) The ramen (not really but let's call it the name it was given by the restaurant) came last even though we asked for it first. Also poor choice in music (over remixed pop; c'mon it's 2017), trying to compensate for it by turning it to a deafening amount of loudness. Poor service overall. It's cold in here. I won't recommend coming here but if you do, bring a jacket or a shawl. MOSQUITOS EVERYWHERE. I MEAN EVERYWHERE.

"Decided to pay Tokyo Express a visit - took us few minutes to find the place. If you are coming from Gulshan-Banani Brdige-end Just do a left on Road 9 then take the first right. Restaurant is on the ground floor and before you reach the main entrance you pass a few tables occupied by mostly university student types and smokers. As I went in, first thing I noticed is that the restaurant has very poor acoustics and was very loud - specially the inside rooms. I asked the Waite...r to explain the menu as he did, I was unable to understand half of what he said - problem with both his English and Bangla pronunciation. The decor was average, Steel cutleries already showing wear and narrow ends of chopsticks are worn out – the shiny coating has come off exposing the wood like material. Tokyo Express should provide disposable or better quality chopsticks as micro food particles can easily stick to the exposed material. We were just given one small empty sauce bowl for our soy sauce/wasabi mix to dunk our sushi - there were two of us and they should have given us two sauce bowl as I personally do not like to share my sauce bowl with others. We ordered the the assorted sushi dish, Chicken Nanban and Osaka spicy beef and fried rice. The Sushi tasted quite good 2 pieces each - of prawn, cuttlefish and salmon. The sushi rice could be of better quality. This would make the sushi extremely good. Chicken Nanban is an average dish but was quite delicious. Made with ice cube sized chicken breast pieces on a light sauce. Sauce tasted like Oyster sauce with soy sauce and sugar added in. A very plain dish. Osaka spicy beeft also tasted very nice - dry shredded beef cooked in hot and light teriyaki sauce and spring onion. The dish was quite tasty. Fried rice also tasted nice but seemed just a tad bit oily. Cooked in less oil the dish would taste just as good. The watermelon juice was average; it was naturally sweet but lacked body and volume. Bill was just above Taka 2000. For the price Tokyo express is a good value with decent food. Although I was not wowed by any of the dishes, I was not disappointed either. Definitely recommended for sushi (at least for the price) and casual lunch and dinner. The menu choice is very limited; I would advice the owners to add more items. >M.M",4.0,

The staff member who talked to me had confirmed and assured me that the reservation was placed. At 2:15 AM when we actually arrived at the restaurant, we got to know that this reservation was never communicated to the sehri shift staff member. Kudos to them for their great professionalism :) But this was only the start. They served us the first plate at 3:27 AM, a mere 11 minutes before the sehri deadline. We waited for more than an hour thinking that okay they didn't communicate the reservation among themselves but surely a franchise like Sbarro will be able to serve up some platters in 30- 40 minutes. We were dead wrong. Even after taking such a long time, they didn't serve the full platter. Barely half of the offerings were plated in front of us. Sadly, all these things weren't the most pathetic part of the experience. This sham of a restaurant they are running didn't even have spoons! Yes, a restaurant without spoons. We had rush-eat rice with a fork and a knife. With 11minutes till the sehri deadline.",1.0,

Kudos to them for their great professionalism :) But this was only the start. They served us the first plate at 3:27 AM, a mere 11 minutes before the sehri deadline. We waited for more than an hour thinking that okay they didn't communicate the reservation among themselves but surely a franchise like Sbarro will be able to serve up some platters in 30- 40 minutes. We were dead wrong. Even after taking such a long time, they didn't serve the full platter. Barely half of the offerings were plated in front of us. Sadly, all these things weren't the most pathetic part of the experience. This sham of a restaurant they are running didn't even have spoons! Yes, a restaurant without spoons.

"I don't know what happened 4 months ago with all these negative reviews. Sbarro had always been my most favorite pizzeria in Bangladesh. I'm almost a regular in this shop. I'm a big fan of their Gulshan outlet. Tobay I visited their Bailey Road outlet. Mr. Masud Rana served me all the way with kind and good professionalism. I ordered 1 NY cheese, 1 NY chicken tikka, 1 NY hot & spicy and 2 Iced lemon tea (My all time favourite). All of them tasted really good. Specially the NY... hot & spicy (Definitly recommended). Sbarro always served the most fresh dough or crust. It felt soft and well baked. They use just the amount of cheese the pizza needs. They do well with the pizza sauce they use. Perfect tasting pepperoni. Well seasoned. Not everyone is going to love all of the pizza flavours. But I think you'll definitly find one you'd love. I have jsut a small issue with the Iced lemon tea. Except mohammadpur and maybe dhanmondi outlet, I've been to every other one. In the original Gulshan outlet they use huge beer mugs for the Iced lemon tea. But in some other outlets you'll find them using thin narrow glasses to serve the lemon tea which is sad. And the taste varries from outlet to outlet. The taste is like a hit or miss. They should try to fix that. And I liked the fact that only they had their one signature 18"" sized pizzas in BD. I hated it when they started introducing different sizes for their pizza. Well, it's just me complaining. Happy feasting.",5.0,

"Heard a lot about Sbarro, but never went there in last 2 years. When I saw the opening post (after the BESTever QR Code campaign and BEST quality Facebook post design), I, along with 3 other friends went to the Asad Avenue Outlet. As it is the soft launching phase, so I am not judging them based on their service. This is all about FOOD QUALITY. The crust was as thick as pillow (বালিশ). The closest competitor in terms of crust thickness would be Captain's World (which I had ...when Ashraful was our Cricket Captain and always regretted before today). Apart from the crust, the pizza was TASTELESS. Maybe you might think I have too Bangali a taste bud, but I never wrote bad review about any place. Yes, I have never been to NY but I have been to Europe 2 times. I am this furious because I have spent BDT 2550 for 1 KG of plain flour crust. Sorry, I could not take it.",1.0,
"I went to the mohammadpur branch before the opening day only to try out the pizza. They said only 4 pizzas were available,the rest will come after 5th October,the opening day. So we had a pizza which was available and it was good. Then they provided us with some coupons and told that we'll get 20% discount on these items till 15th October. Then again we went there after the day of opening and showed them the coupon but the servers said that those items were not available. The...y also said if I want to use these coupons and want to have that meal I have to go to another outlet as the mohammadpur outlet didn't have those meals. I mean it is already opened! Why does it still don't have combos and other things available? Every outlet has launched together so every outlet should also have same pizzas and other items available! You guys should take care of that. Otherwise the pizza was good.",4.0,

And also I would like ...to add an extra suggestion in the end. The VAT is okay But I have never seen to take service charges from the customers or billing with VAT and SC or DC whatever. I would recommend that as the pizza prices are a bit high, so why not include or adjust the extra charges with the item prices. I hope this review would be taken into account seriously. Thank you.

He took us to d the first floor in d same building arranged a table to sit till ifter and promised us to give t...he first table after d ifter.And we got d table after 1 hour of ifter.It's true We started having pizza after 1 hour but we did not miss anything.They served all d flavours one after another. So service should be like ds.Thank you so very much Sbarro Bangladesh for d hospitality. Thanks to the operation head Ehsanul Kabir .

Nice Environment Quality � Great Service Freindly Behaviour. **By the way they served us ifter also**",5.0,
"So I went there for the unlimited offer during Ramadan. Pizzas were really good. Hot, cheesy, crisp and tasty. All of the flavors were served. Service was satisfactory. Sunny bhai did a really good job. Drinks were watered down but it works for me coz I don't like the fizz. On the negative side, too crowdy and they added many extra tables and chairs. It was like a fish market ! The heat of the ovens neutralized the cold air of ac, so it was hot inside the restaurant. Food was good but atmosphere was horrible.",4.0,

This is my first review. Went to Sbarro Bangladesh last week! If you are a pizza lover then you should definitely go there. So they serve 7 kinds of pizza . And I'm rating them according to how it tasted to me ... So here it goes. 1. Super supreme : 8/10 2. NY chicken Tikka: 9.5/10 3. NY cheese : 9/10 4. NY spicy beef: 8.5/10 5. Chicken Italian sausage :8/10 6. NY mushroom pizza : 7.5/10 7. Chocolate dessert pizza :8/10 Environment: 10/10 Everyone was absolutely well behaved. The atmosphere was energetic mostly cuz the game was going on. NB: the ratings above are based on my personal experience. It may vary from taste to taste.,5.0,

"I guess they serve the best pizza in Dhaka and the fillings on the pizza were too delicious. More over, their service was too good. We got Shojib & Kakoli who served us really well & with their generous hospitality behaviour made us feel like home. We took unlimited pizza offer. As usual NY cheese, NY mushroom & chicken tikka hold their top position in my favorite list. Keep it up Sbarro. Good news: Sbarro is launching 8 more branches around Dhaka city soon. So, it's a request to Sbarro team, please always try to maintain the same quality as they are now. Cause many renowned pizza restaurants have degraded their quality gradually for profit.",5.0,

"[I did not have Sbarro's food so my review is based on their service only] Earlier today I messaged Sbarro asking if they took any reservations, and they replied saying that they did not in fact take any reservations and that it's on first come first serve basis. Which seemed fine to me. When I went there later on today, it was jam packed with people as expected but what surprised me was when the guard asked me if I had a reserved table or not. And then one of the waiters as...ked me the same thing as well. Lots of people were still going inside because they had reserved their seats and I just stood there surprised that they denied taking reservations earlier today and lo and behold they actually did take reservations. In the end me and my siblings had to dine elsewhere. This kind of confusing service is extremely disappointing, especially coming from Sbarro which is widely lauded to have amazing service. And this was our first time there too. My question is this, if you did take reservations then why deny that fact to a potential customer?",1.0,

On the positive side, The slices were colder than their AC for sure. Chilling experience in a hot weather!!! You can also eat the slices upside down. ... Don't worry, the toppings are glued, so they won't fall off. What a trick to impress your girlfriend!!! Ofcourse, if you have one. A slice of cold, hard, ruti with little less harder toppings. Even the garlic mushroom had too much garlic!!! Pepsi was literally the best thing on your menu!!! On a serious note, if you are charging 220+vat for a slice, i expect quality!!!

"So no complaints about the food which was excellent or the price which I found reasonable. But the staff have massive problems communicating with the customer or operating the sales counters. So this afternoon I head in, the place is nearly empty and I ask for a stromboli that isnt vegetables based. Four different staff offer me three kinds of vegetable based stromboli for ten minutes before one of them realizes I want a meat based stromboli and apologizes that they don't ha...ve any, wasting 10 minutes of my life. Then I head to the counter to pay, at which point the girl behind the counter presses buttons on the computer for several minutes before realising that the counter doesn't work. She apologizes. I ask her if I should go to my seat and wait for them to bill me or whether I should leave the note with her and wait for them to give me the change. She apologizes, I repeat my question. Other waiters join her in apologizing. A small crowd of apologetic waiters gather around me as I ask my question seven times and get seven rounds of apologies from more and more waiters. Then someone figures out that they can open the counter with the key that's next to the counter. At which point they take my Tk 500 note and give me my 30 Tk in change in three torn 10Tk notes, all three of which were scotch taped down the centre. At this point I should have known better than to ask, but I went ahead and asked for a pizza sauce to go with the pizza. I recieved three boxes of chilli powder/paprika from four different waiters before someone figured out what sauce was. 2/10 for service.",3.0,

I ordered from hungrynaki.com BBQ chicken price is too much for only a leg piece. I ordered and paid for Chicken fried rice but they delivered egg white rice !!! Quantity of every item should be increased in comparison to price. I strongly suggest to include image of every item so that consumers do not get disappointed.,,True
"The environment is very beautiful with lots of plants and a majestic walkway. The interior decor is nice with bright and dim lights and nice furniture. The menu is a bit large for my standards but some people like choices. The staff and server were friendly from the start. The waiting time for our food was a bit longer than usual; maybe because they were making the food from scratch. The Garlic Mushroom was a bit dry; not as juicy as it should be. The Seafood Salad was fresh,... Oh yeah, one more thing, I felt like the plating was below par. Without putting food on the plate, display the creativity of your chef, your restaurant and that will attract customers to come back for more.",4.0,

"The Blissful BBQ Bash of m cafe costing 300 TK. The presentation of the food was good but they can improve it,well the taste of the food was not up to the mark.The rice tastes good but the quantity of it needs to be increased,the salad that they gave I think it should be sliced more thickly then it would have been better. On the other hand the BBQ ckicken was perfect, according to me it was perfectly cooked, in each an every bite the juicy flavoured of the chicken could be felt ,the BBQ sauce was a perfect combination with it.So over all it was not up to the mark of the pricing stratagy,the pricing should be around 230-250 TK. I know that a cafe have some overhead costs but still charging 300 TK on it, makes the food expensive comparing to the taste and quantity.",2.0,

"Wish could give a higher rating !!! We had an office party there on 22 Dec 17 of 30 guests. We needed separate seating arrangements for gents and ladies with different aged kids. They just did what I wanted. Even they kept one separate room for mothers who need to feed their babies. As it was Christmas season, so the hall was superbly decorated. The seating arrangement was not that quite but sufficiently spacious. About food, they were exceptional in case of choosing items i...n comparison to other hotels who offer the buffet of the same price range. They did not have 2/3 types Biriyani/ Rice items or any other similar food. There was no duplication of any menu. Starter items like soup and other snacks were not typical and were delicious. Ther main attractions were Small Lobster and Beef Steak. In addition to that, they had seafood and fish items too. They had variety in dessert items which we could not try as we were almost full then. We never saw an empty dish there. Whenever it was finished they refilled it without any further delay.They maintained high standard food quality throughout. If I don't say about two persons in this review then it will be an injustice to them which I must not do. Our party was a successful one only because of Restaurant Manager Mr. Zilhaj Parvez. He made everything in a way that we all felt like home. He was always there to fulfill our every requirement. Along with him, mess waiters were also very polite and professional with a smiling face. Another person is Md. Tazul Islam, Senior Security Officer, and an Ex Military person who ensured our tension free foodie time. As there was a shortage of underground parking, we had to park our cars outside. But this man ensured us about the security and was there with his troops till last maintaining extreme professional attitude. At last, all of us came out from there with a smiley face and satisfied heart. We all will look forward to going there time and again. Hope they keep their standard up always.",5.0,
"Tried their buffer dinner offer. Was not expecting this! We went quite early around 7.30-8 but already all the food was cold! They warmer was not working. After mentioning it they fixed it. Worst suchi i ever tried, also with a foul smell!! But the worst was when we tried their firni it was totally sour with a foul smell. We showed it to the waiter n latter the chef confirmed that it has gone bad. They offered us another but by that time we were done! The manager was present but he didn't say anything! On the other hand the waiters and the assistant manager was nicer n more polite. Other Food items were okay, nothing extraordinary.

I hope you will improve your food quality. Best of luck,2.0,

I also ordered bowl of their Spicy Noodles and as soon as I tossed it once to cool it I noticed a tiny roach lying dead among other ingredients, which immediately killed my appetite to eat or revisit Fools Diner anymore...

First of all they wanted to amuse their customers by providing free food. But in that case it must be tasty or according to their description. Unfortunately it had a blunder taste. The fried chicken size was 1/3 of the given picture ones. The sizzling had hardly any chicken but full of carrots. Imagine caram... They took order of 5 cold drinks but served 4, when we asked the reason they said they ran out of cold drinks. Even they didn’t have mineral water as well. Later on request they brought us a 500 ml bottle from downstairs. Now tell me in what kind of restaurants they ran out of drinking water??? It was a mistake of going after in such offers. Just thought they earlier provided good food so can give it a try. But sorry never again. ���",1.0,

I hitted 3 stars because i think overall is good. First of all I would just like to thank you for the fantastic evening we spent at your restaurant on Sunday 24th September 2017. Secondly i would like to say that I & my friends ordered BBQ chicken with Fried rice. Specially thanks for your service and your decoration was well decorated and i love that place.

How come a restaurant like Cafe theatre have a single oven? If they don't have a single oven they could prepare our pizzas on the others right?? But as they had one and it wasn't working so they couldn't provide us with Pizzas!! lol I'm laughing my ass off and I'm angry like an active volcano in the same time as I've paid for the foods we had and we couldn't have what we wanted. The place is nice but their service us very poor. I think it was our bad omen that we went their to celebrate our birthday program. I won't ever go there and will tell friends too no to go there as well",1.0,
"So for my sister's birthday, we ordered takeout of the BBQ platter for four and got enough food to feed at least 6 people. To be honest, the food was mostly excellent. The Mexican rice was splendid. The chicken wings and the chicken sizzling were finger licking good. We found the green sauce too spicy, especially for those who can't consume spicy food. The disappointment was the BBQ chicken which weren't barbequed at all! There was no searing on the outside, the char a barbequed chicken is supposed to have was nonexistent. There was zero spice in it. Also, we found hair in several dishes which is totally unacceptable. I hope in future you'll improve your dishes more. Keep up the good work with the rice, the chicken wings and the chicken sizzling but please be more sincere about the quality and hygiene of your food.",4.0,

By that time they have already rounded up all the chairs and tables, which itself is not right if the official closing time is 11 pm. We ordered 4 cappuccino and were... waiting for our Sister to arrive.When she arrived at 11:00 pm they had already closed the sliding door. One of the staffs stopped her outside when she said my coffee has been ordered and they are waiting inside, which can be seen through the glass. The staffs kept arguing with her and given that the sliding door has already been turned off she got hurt hitting the glass door. This is sad as you feel unwelcome in a reputed coffee boutique.

After a long time had tasted freshly brewed coffee. It was adequately prepared.Chocolate chip cookie was a bit like a brownie though, also liked the date bar.

"So I have been a customer of Pizza Inn since it started in Dhaka with their own building in Gulshan,Dhaka. I really liked eating pizza here. But what yesterday happened what just really disappointing. Look people make mistakes. I know that. I saw mistakes in Pizzas since day one. But you people improved. Then you reached the top of pizza chain (atleast to me). But yesterday's service just dragged you down to the last. So like any other day, I went with my family to eat ...pizza around 7 p.m. I sat at my usual place in second floor. Then there was this offer going on where you buy 1 large pizza and get another one absolutely free. So i ordered this BBQ Chicken classic pizza with the another one Pizza Inn Special which costed more. So obviously they took the second one as my order and the first one as the free one. It took them about 20 mins which is usual. They first gave the pizza inn special pizza. No fork or knives were in the table. They never offered one too. Then after I asked, they gave them. The waiter also had lack of knowledge about service (It was not his fault btw because he wasn't trained well. And i even tipped him well because he was really young) Then there came my usual and most favourite flavour BBQ. But it was really disappointing when i tasted the second one (BBQ). It tasted exactly like the first was. It was extremely disappointing to eat two pizzas with the same flavour even i ordered two different ones. I asked the waiter about that but he said he didn't know. I hope you review you your mistakes because I myself never expected this kind of service. My family also got disappointed which made me feel sad because I was the one to force them to eat here whilst they wanted to eat elsewhere....",1.0,

"A story of disappointment and deception -_- Poorest food, price and service I have ever experienced! I am totally shocked at your response to the queries of the customers. It took about 40 minutes to deliver pizzas. Almost all the items are overpriced. The pasta I ordered was not worth 475 taka at all. Also, it was almost chilled, didn't look like you cooked it after I ordered. The waiter was always confused to our questions. You put the different columns for pizzas and crusts, well fine. But why there were no thin crusts which we ordered? Your worthless waiter was insisting us to order the high priced ones! That's how the pizza wich was shown taka 660 or something turned into 990 taka! Cunning policy, indeed. Totally disappointed at your work. Never coming again.",1.0,
"First of all they are not worthy enough to give even one star but since this is the minimum rating, I am giving one. Their delivery is very time consuming and on top of that they more or less forced us to take their stuffed crust which is of BDT 295. They have thin crush which they don't charge extra money for but that was not available. So it clearly proves that they are taking extra money for their so called stuffed crust forcefully! Now a days customers are willing to spend extra money on good food so you don't have to steal it from us showing lame excuses. If that is your business strategy then I suggest you to develop your business skills along with your pizza taste! They wrote BDT 600++ for their medium sized pizza but they took 990 instead because of stuffed crust which is so not worth the money!",1.0,

Currently no one knows the actual status of its international franchisee license and clearly they don't care about the quality of food anymore.

As many good competitors have risen up now, you don't have to eat the DRY, RUBBERY pasta, and TASTELESS, generic pizza they serve, not anymore.

Dates, rooh-afza & cold drinks were quickly served & just before azaan, two slices of pizza were given to each of us.

Ultimately, you have to fetch them yourselves. Paid for about 4k Tk, all of which feels completely wasted on nothing.",1.0,

"Worst pizza ever tasted. Ordered pizza with sausage crust. They gave it wrong. When complained, they replied saying they got technical issues (which was a very lame excuse). They used local cheese instead of Mozzarella. Made a chaos during providing the bill too. Overall I would have given a negative 5 if there was an option. All I can say is, train your waiters first before starting an outlet.",1.0,

"Whenever we crave for pizza 'pizza inn' just pop into our mind. But this time it went horribly wrong. After having their pizza my wife vomit 2 to 3 times. I was feeling sick too. Another thing to save the time for making pizza quick they just put cheese and toppings on their ready made crust. Then they put it in the oven . Done in 5mins may be less than that. I'm not lying . Still have couple of slices left in my fridge. Plz guys instead of bringing more branch , bring some quality. And for me adios 'Pizza inn'. From Uttara - a never coming back customer.",1.0,

Worst experience ever... if you can't serve your own menu items then you should close the outlet of uttara.. and stuff was like please get out... just because gas problem in uttara they can't even serve frnchfries... also they can't make coldbeverage items.. funny.. btw cant explain the test of the pizza.. crust is like toast... so please if you can't maintain your standard then stop making foolish people.,1.0,

Pizza inn shouldn't introduce such offer where they cant maintain the minimum standard. This has been my favourite pizza shop in town always even in such offer time. This time i heard so many bad comments from friends but with my previous experience I ignored to believe them and here i am today with utter disappointments.

"I went to your Uttara outlet to avail the ""FNF Offer"" today around 09:00PM. Before going there, i checked your website and decided to order One Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza Large & One Deep Dish Pizza Large. When I was ordering Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza Large, the waiter told me that there is no such Pizza of Pizza Inn named Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza Large. When I told him that I have checked your website, he replied it can't be there. After that when I told him about t...he Deep Dish Pizza, he replied it is not included in the Offer. He also told me ""Deep Dish Pizza is very EXPENSIVE. It will cost around TK.1800."" Now my questions are: 1. If there is no such Pizza of Pizza Inn named Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza Large, then why you are displaying in your website? 2. If I have checked your website, then I am certain about the prices of the Products. Do you tell your customers that ""Sir, this Pizza is expensive. Don't take this one? Later I ordered BBQ Chicken Classic Large & Meaty Max Pizza Large. This is not the first time I am getting this kind of customer service from your Uttara Branch. Several months back, I experienced this kind of unprofessional customer service. But I ignored that time, because I get better service in your Banani & Gulshan Branch. You simply can't run your business with this kind of unprofessional team. One will not surely pay for getting this kind of shitty service.",1.0,
Stupidest service at your Uttara outlet. your staff doesn't have any clue of your online offers. They first said Pizzainn does not have any pizza called Roasted garlic chicken pizza.

"Came today for the first time here with loads of expectations. I had today one chicken tandoori pizza, one french fries, chicken drumsticks and one apple juice. The pizza was so oily and loaded with cheese and for that reason, i didn't like that. I couldn't find the exact taste of pizza because all i could find was the taste of cheese and cheese. So i didn't like the pizza at all. The french fries was good btw. But the drumsticks was so tasteless that i couldn't eat them all.... They were loaded with so much masalas that i couldn't find the actual taste of it also. I didn't like that one also. Lastly comes the apple juice. I couldn't understand whether it was apple juice or not. Because bad smell was coming from that juice. So i didn't have that one also. Not going to come here anymore. Waste of money!!!!!

Had chicken pasta and cashew nut salad. Pasta was very bland. Not enough seasonings and lack of any kind of taste. Amount of meat or mushroom was tiny. White sauce they surved was weird and .

The Pasta - it seems to me that I had a bowl of water with some cheese.....disgusting. Chicken Fry (leg) overcooked. Very much dissapointed of overall experience as we went with Family. I guess weather they are going to close their business very soon or they have a bunch of BigHead (!) chef (?) with bad tamper. 😠",,False

First of all give up the habit of hawking people like Gulistan to your restaurant..Haven't seen this ever at any elite restaurant of this area.. . had pasta here which was 3/5.. it lacked chicken and cheese horribly..you can hardly find any of these in the middle and last parts..I should also personally say it lacked salt and spice(don't know about other people).. I think you guys need to stop the buy 1 get 1 shit and instead bring up your focus to the taste... for decoration I would rate 4/5.. it looks good overall thanks to the decorators.. Best of luck for future.. hope you guys can make quick improvement and cope up with the other famous restaurants in the food valley named Khilgaon �,3.0,

The overall taste was good but for 279tk, considering the toppings, it was overpriced. The making of pizza in an oven in front of you is the main attention.

Its just lack of training.i worked and study in hotel management abord and I run many places abord so I have bit idea in hospitality sector so I hope the management will see my review and they will fix those small issue.

We felt salads and dessert items poor and limited. I found small hair in different dishes which disturbed me a lot but I did not say anything as my mates could lose their appetite.

The texture of the pizza is wonderful. Though it is layered by the sauce and meat and the cheeses on top, it still holds everything in place. It doesnt get soggy or soft which is essential for a good pizza. And not to forget, every bite gives you a very satisfying cheese pull which is to die for 😍 Overall, i would highly recommend.",,True

They've a good ambience I must say. The service was fast and quick. The waiters were good at there job. But I didn't like the taste of their pizza and if you're not good at what you're offering then service and ambience won't do any good. There were sufficient amount of cheese but which tasted super crapy and I find the amount of onions were much more than the actual topping. I ordered the Family Size Double Trouble and Buffalo Wings. The wings tasted decent enough. So If before you visit this place give it a thought coz there are far better options. And Yeah The Pricing was okay for me not expensive at all and obviously affordable. Thanks,2.0,

"I was in a mood for pizza today and wanted to try something new. After having received the ad cut menu on my door a month ago,B.B.Q Al Pollo pizza was on my mind. So decided to try it out today.

The pizza was very tasty, had a lot of Parmesan, cheddar and mozzarella cheese flavour accompanied by pepperoni. This was fully satisfactory meal. Wouldn't hesitate to come back again.",5.0,

"Got 2 pizzas an hour back through foodpanda. I must say I'm very disappointed with the amount of toppings you guys have given. The small squared slices of pepperoni was insignificant in the family sized pizza in comparison with the 900+tk you guys charge for one!

Worst service ever! We bought 2 coupons for the ‘boishakhi food fair’ on pohela boishakh and when we reach the restaurant (26th floor) they kept telling to wait because they were gonna shift it to lobby. We complained and they reluctantly served us food some food and kept us waiting for our remaining food while not even giving us any importance that we kept waiting (even though the food was ready). We got so annoyed we left without even eating. Waste of 1000tk coupon. Worst service and unwelcoming looks from the waiters as we waited for the food. NEVER going back,1.0,

"A person who knows me can tell that I just live for good food and I love eating at different places where it is a 5 star or anything else. The Friday brunch of Four Points by Sheraton is awesome to treat yourself after a hectic week. It is a place which is very soothing and their staffs will make sure that you'll feel cozy there. I have been to Le Méridien, Westin and Raddison too but if you ask me which place serves you the best food then I'll say it is Four Points by Sherat...on. Now let's talk about the food, the best thing they will serve you is live juice station from the entire brunch session. The live kitchen has a variety of items to offer and to me the prawn tempura and the omelette with cheese were the best. They also serve you live pasta station. I had the best white sauce pasta with cheese, spices and chicken today. It was so yummy that I had the desire to start licking the plate. The main dishes were yummy too. The main thing is they will set a line of main dishes that you will want to eat like no dishes you'll not want to eat.

"Well we had 1 ifter and 2 sehri in Four points, it is one of the indication of their improved menu and services! As their tower section is the new addition in the Ramadan menu, I must said they are providing great foods. Ramadan teaches us not to waste, so i tried to eat as much as possible but not keep any weste foods in the plate! I like the most is they did not put tons of variety rather quality foods and all that you can eat. All the stuffs are very friendly, they keep asking the guests if they need anything more. They tried to provide the best possible service. Apart from that. The view from the 24th floor is awesome! The manager Mr. Tareq and assistant manager Mr. Shaifur Rahman provide quality service and they are always on the move, asking guests if they were happy or not! Overall, we are satisfied customers! :)",5.0,

The Sehri buffet spread were completely worth of the price for a SPG property. It was good in taste. Some items were just outstanding like The 'Paya'or ' or 'nehari' Salad and fruits bar was good and main dishes were mouthwatering. Second visit is awaiting sometime soon.,5.0,
"They are charging almost 4,000 (3,999) BDT for the buffet but do not bother to make arrangement to keep the food warm. Cold food ruined the taste of the items. My brother went there with his guest yesterday & became embarrassed of the food situation. if you don't want to keep your kebabs hot, then don't charge that much cz other buffets are charging less but giving better service than you. Pissed Off",2.0,

"Clearly a waste of time and money . The dishes were way below average . Nothing resembled the advertisement. Pure Deshi cuisine plus a few salads and desserts is not worth 2200 taka. Last but not least , the restroom was dirty and stall was too small for a hotel. ... Pizza Hut has a bigger washroom than yours . Definitely not coming back here anymore . Shall never recommend anyone to come here either .",1.0,

"quantity was there .. but lacked quality somewhat. nothing spectacular or exceptional to make it a stand apart experience. it was nice of them to include the juice bar with the buffet & service was upto the mark too. quality of beef being served can be improved, i found it bit hard to chew. desserts section was unimaginative .. lots of different types of cupcakes .. again nothing exceptional was noted.. lacked chocolate based items or any mousse & yogurts were missing too. BIGGEST DRAWBACK WAS SERVICE STOPPING AT 3:30 pm. In context of Bangladesh, it should have been minimum 4:00 pm. & a closeby smoking section would be nice. having 2 change lifts to get to their rooftop smoking area wasn't fun.",3.0,

This was worse experience of being there at eatery restaurant. In the street food market fest there were no Chinese dim sum station. There was sushi but very limited.

"Very nice family place with good ambiance. Good food and better service. Will come again surely. Beverages should be included with the buffet. When you've advertised that the price mentioned is of all inclusive, then charging of VAT & others shouldn't be in place.... That doesn't bring good news to YOU. Anyway, overall I liked it and visit again to see new developments. Cheers!",5.0,
"Staff were really friendly, everything works, loved it",5.0,
"Most of the items were below average. Though there are many dishes, most of them don't deserve more than a bite. The advertisement is not all revealing, though it mentions Buy 1 Get 1 on Stan Chart Cards, there are particular specifications of the cards with offer, not all Standard Chartered Cards are liable to get the offer. And most importantly, though the advertisement mentions the Buffet price to be 3542 ( all inclusive), what has not been mentioned is that this excludes all beverages including water which will be charged at an exhorbitant rate plus 26.5% extra VAT and service charge on that. So those who are planning to go to the Street Food Festival, think twice.",2.0,
The food was horrible compared to la meridian while taking price in account. The restaurant eatery was small and had a handful to offer. I called them up to enquire about the maki rolls before going and found premade small rolls that was tasteless and looked cheep. Their continental side had few things to offer aswell. All in all dnt waste your money and time.,1.0,

"Located at the heart of the modern part of Dhaka, just at Gulshan-2 circle. the 28-floored Doreen Tower has been modified as this hotel. Though some of its floors are being used as office spaces but completely isolated from the hotel. They have started new, some of their staffs I met have been recruited from other hotels like Westine, Amari etc. and they know well how provide service to customers. Their restaurant and food menus I experienced found very selective and well cooked. Restaurant is in 24th floor with good view of outside. Specially their restaurant lounge at 27th floor will give you a splendid beautiful overview of the city which must be liked by all to have some time there to drink, smoke or to dine with nearest ones, so don't miss it!",4.0,

I always like their pizza specially chili lime prawn and the pepperoni pizza. However was extremely disappointed with meatball spaghetti and the store don’t serve any mineral water neither they provide any house water in Dhanmondi branch that is disappointing....,,True
"Expanding business from Gulshan and Banani to Dhanmondi was a bad move for Pizza Roma basically cause it meant their quality being degraded. A stale pizza diavola with a hard crust and chewy dough was delivered with no sauces or chili flakes, especially when extra sauces was an added request. More than annoying, bad pizzas are just disappointing specifically considering Pizza Roma is the pizzeria we've all come to love.",1.0,

As I respect this Politics Party due to Nation Father Banga Bandhu Sheck Mujebur Rahman, But Mr. JAf...or Alam is using name and fame of Bangladesh Awamilig which is very unfortunet for us and me. This will be very dangerous for all chakaria upezala residence because he will make more black money and make more terrorism and land mafia in chakaria.

The food was good enough. biriyanis tasted quite near delicious. taste - 9/10 But service!!!!! OMFG!!!!! I have never felt so miserable. went there with some of my friends and a elder brother. They treated us like SHIT. let me give you an example. we had to wait for 10 minutes for a bowl of daal only. they kept forgetting the orders. 1st of all they gave us only 3 glasses. But we were 7/8 sitting in the table. when we asked for more glass they gave us dirty glasses and that also after waiting for 5 minutes. And when we asked for the manager they didn't even pay any attention. Even though we were sitting just before the cash counter.

Beef Nugamba or something (cant remember the name) - same as chicken curry. Although a bit different but doesn't have any srilankan touch. Moju - very good.

"3 of us attended for lunch. The decor was minimalist but clean. The waiters were pleasant but need proper training. As this is a new cuisine for most of us, we had to ask for recommendations. This was not voluntarily offered. Even after we advised them of our lack of knowledge about Sri Lankan food. The waiter appeared to suggest the most expensive dishes as opposed dishes that we'd like considering we were describing what we were in the mood for. Ordering the food was a chal...lenge. We ordered a set menu they had available as this would provide the most selection. We also ordered parathas, egg hoppers and a beef curry. The waiters did not make suggestions that we'd need to order this additional food but it was essential for a full meal. It took over 20 minutes for the food to arrive. Once it did, I admit it was tasty but most of it was very spicy. We were not aware of this. We can handle spice but we still would've appreciated the waiters making us aware of it. The staff mentioned 3/4 of our way through the meal that we had two drinks which came with the set menu that we'd ordered. Whether this was done to make us order more drinks or whether the waiters forgot....both are unattractive. The set menu was priced in a manner I would say appropriate but the curry was overpriced. It cost just under 4000tk for 3 of us and in all consideration, this was a tad over what we would've felt was appropriate. I hope the suggestions are considered thoughtfully. I enjoyed the food so we shall be back, inshallah.",3.0,

Way too overpriced with a very typical food type. The portion size is ridiculous. With some other foods we took an egg hopper which costs 197+10% SC +15%VAT plus and its exactly ডিম চিতই which we can get at 15 taka. We had to made ourselves satisfies by dining in at Time out just near Taste of Lanka to satisfy our tummy. The owner claimed they have to import everything from Srilanka (why a guy need to have eggs and beef from Srilanka I did not get it though) which sounded like comedy of Russel Peter to me........and I literally laughed out.....,2.0,

I love their chicken & super cheese burger, my friends used to fear me coz I always wanted to go BFC..haha. but last few years I am not going regular only occasionally, maybe coz there test & quality is not as before but mostly there staff behaviour is really bad sometimes. worst one was recently at there Mohammadpur outlet, I have orderd 4 pic chicken & other things, they gave me 2 Thai & 2 leg. so I asked them can I have a breast pi...c & they just rudely replied that it's there company policy that in 4 pic chicken they will give 2 leg pic & I was just socked coz first he can give a breast by changing a Thai & secondly I have going to BFC since long & was regular at Uttara Jasimuddin branch for long time & never got that kind of behaviour & most of all never heard that policy & it's been almost 15/16 years I have been going there. I will still go there maybe less & maybe not at Mohammadpur but I will go coz I still love having those chicken & just wish they would keep there quality & look after there staff.",,True

"Caution: Experience sharing for better serving. I have been with BFC's food since 2004.for me BFC chicken is the best in the town.I have visited almost all the branches in Dhaka and know many outlet managers those who are working for the last 20 years.But it is really sad to say, BFC, Mirpur 10 branch has got some problems. I have been there several times since I have shifted my residence in Mirpur. The staffs are not well mannered. I have shared some of them, incident 1: one... day they have served me wrong drinks, when i objected the waiter said, it is not possible. incident 2: sometime a portion of the total area is blocked, i requested manager, he ignored. last incident: When a half of the sweet corn are eaten i have found some parts of a steel dish washing net inside, I complained they wanted to give another but i said no.The young outlet Manager was in front of me turned around even saying sorry.I was horrified about thinking their cleaning stuff.Hope authority will frequent visit their outlets and will check hygienic food ,cooking stuff and customers feedback's.DROPBOX is the better idea.and managers should be well trained., so that other staffs can perform better.",2.0,

Had a horrible experience. First of all they made us wait for 45mins for the food. The quantity of the food was less than we have expected. Then after paying the bill we received changes of 2 torn notes of 100 tk that were glued which we didn't notice at the first place.Thank you soo much for the horrible experience. Won't ever come back and surely wouldn't recommend this place to anyone 😑😑😑,,False
"My first review consisted of 5 stars but today, I am bound to revise my review & mark it with 1 star. I am incredibly annoyed with the quantity & the quality of the food items which they provided from their Dhanmondi branch. I ordered online through pathao food. I ordered their platter, R2, & it seemed to me that I paid 2500+ taka for a mere box of French fries!!! I had the same platter twice, before, but they have seemingly deteriorated the quality & lowered the quantity of ...their food items. Probably, they re-use the oil in which they fry their items. There was a distinct smell of used oil. The fish fingers were unbelievably thin & small. I just could see French fries throughout the box & the calamaries & shrimps were very few in numbers. In Ramadan too, I experienced the same thing. I had enough of Manhattan Fish Market. Never ever going back there or ordering food online from them. They literally have lost a regular customer.",1.0,
Fantastic. great service nice interior,,True
I m really feeling sad to say that me and my friend went ur Dhanmondi branch today ... We ordered the Fish and chips (the best deal in the town) menu.... But they gave small pieces of 2 fishs...

"Yesterday's azan was at 6.46 PM. The restaurant had served tang and iced tea beforehand. After the azan, everyone around us had food, except 3 tables. I figured they'd be 4/5 mins late. But nope, we waited there till 7.05 PM and got no food, while there was a table of around 15 people who'd received their second servings by that time. One time, a waiter came to our table with food, we got really excited because we'd been somewhat fasting for an extra 15 minutes, but then the ...waiter went back because that food wasn't for our table; such a tease, innit. At around 7 PM while everyone there was eating their fish and chips and we were sitting with our glass of iced tea, they brought us some really unappetizing, complementary soup. I lost it at that point and asked why they are seating people if they can't make enough food. To which they replied ""Amra chai na kono customer mon kharap koruk."" Bro you aren't serving people food for iftar, I think that's enough for me to ""mon kharap."" So then we left the place, as soon as we get on the lift they say ""Apnader food chole ashche."" As if I'm ever going back. We went to BFC and had super wholesome fried chicken. No ragrets, but f u, The Manhattan FISH MARKET Bangladesh. There was more weird shit before this, of course. I'd asked on Facebook whether or not the restaurant takes reservations, and they'd replied that they don't have any booking system in their outlets. They said that they serve people on a ""first come, first serve"" basis so it'd be best if we show up at least 45 minutes before iftar. I called the number given on your Facebook page and website again today at around 3 pm to check if you really don't take bookings. The cellphone was switched off. So we went to the Dhanmondi outlet at 5 PM today, and they told us they couldn't seat two people because all seats were booked. I told them that whoever manages their social media doesn't know that they take bookings, and if I show up at 5 at a virtually empty restaurant that serves iftar ""first come, first get,"" then I should get a table. Then they found us a table, lol. They took our order for an iftar platter at around 6 pm. After 15 minutes or so, they came to confirm it, and their receipt had the items ""garlic mussels, water"" whereas we'd ordered fish and chips and chicken tenders. We told them that they'd taken a completely wrong order for some reason. I mean, I'd understand if they'd thought we ordered grilled fish instead of fried, but mussels???? What??? But then we got no food at all because MUSSELS KHAIBI NA TOH MANHATTAN FISH MARKET AISOS KEN",1.0,
The best sea food seller and passionate to serve emotionally in the region. just fell in love with their great service.,,True
This was my first visit to MFM and my experience was awful. I ordered chicken mussels calamari and for drinks I ordered sunset by the bay and lemongrass cooler. The drinks were so disgusting that we both could not take the second sip of those. The drinks were smelling like cockroach and cough syrup and the chicken was smelly too. The spice in the mussels was not good at all. The only good thing was the fries. I would not recommend this place for anything. We ordered coleslaw which was not served and thank God for that. We had some issues with the bill as well. They should improve the sincerity to their customers.,1.0,

This place is one of the only two decent seafood restaurants in Dhaka. This one provides a greater value for money and heartier portions. Did you ask for a single saucer of dipping?

All in all, highly disappointing experience. When we informed the management about the mishap, they were sprouting ridiculous BS as if we customers are dumb af.

"For the first time, I have ordered two pizzas for home delivery. When they arrived, there was a terrible smell from the chicken one (Mexican Hot). Maybe it was their misplaced extra topping that made it worse as I ordered for extra cheese and not a buck-load of mushrooms. The beef one (Beef Bolognese) had no pepperoni on it. Moreover, the cheese they put felt dry & dusty and the dough felt real hard to swallow. Subpar ingredients, false advertisements ??........ maybe, maybe ... Lesson well learnt. Ramadan is definitely not an apt time to order comfort food. I consider myself simply, unlucky in this gamble.",2.0,
1st time visited the place.. was extremely hungry.. requested the serving boy to give us the best options as we are new here.. unfortunately he did not guide us properly.. plus they playing the music too loudly so he did not listen our drinks order properly.. when we asked to change the drink.. he was very rude.. already we requested them to low the sound.. overall a horrible experience,,False
"We ordered their bowl-less pasta which is quite hyped these days.

Overall the whole thing was a beautiful package of bursting tastes that will explode in your mouth.

"Last food experience was horrible! I was craving for chicken cashew nut salad & thus ordered this from them, along with a set menu via Hungrynaki. The cashew nut salad which they provide with their set menu is completely different from that of the individual dish. I haven't, in my whole, tasted such disgusting chicken cashew nut salad. It smells like beguni & pakora. They fry extemely thin & mini slices of chicken,(almost invisible), by covering them up with a huge amount of ...besan & flour which is responsible for this weird smell. There was abnormal thick coating in each of the chicken slices. The cashew nut salad which they provide with the set menu atleast contains capicum slices but the individual dish contains onions & cucumber only! Horrible...horrible experience. My craving was being killed by their food & I literally threw it away. They should & must stop cheating people by coating up their meat pieces with unnecessary amount of besan & flour to make them look bigger. I had the same experience with one of their beef items. The quality of their wrapped prawns has deteriorated too. There is too much of noodles & the prawns are incredibly thin & small. & the dish is too try but previously their wrapped prawns were juicy. I used to order from them a lot via Hungrynaki but the last time made me too disappointed with the quality of their dishes & have decided not to order from them anymore since you get only fried besan & flour.",1.0,

worst food...bad behaviour of the waiters...,,False
Nice place nice Environment.,,True
Hello ! Im from banasree and kind of a frequent customer of baba rafi branch . Last couple of times i had a common problem in this branch. They are not willing to take order as per my choice from the given menu but i had to take the foods what they want due to their manpower or some other reason. Today also the same thing happened . There is a new menu launched Chicken quesadilla and i wanted to order but they are not taking this order as it will take time and i agreed to wait but still they wont coz its not easy for them to make ! My question is why you keep such item on menu when you are not taking the order and have to order as u want when u have a menu?? This is not common for other branch of baba rafi . I want management to look into this and take needed action on this .thanks .,2.0,
I did order from pathao. And The food was totally cold. It was beef fried chicken. It is the second time and last time.,,False
"It's good actually. The only problem i had was from a new item that i had yesterday. It was Tandoori Burger. It was too hot and spicy but was not mentioned in the description. It tasted really good, but a bit of heads up in the description would have been much better.",4.0,
Burger patty is very disappointingly tasteless and too much mayo that also didn't taste good. Incomplete menu,,False
"What’s up with your cost saving techniques? Ac out fans running, one man doing cash, preparation and serving. If you claim to be an international chain but serve like a local street shop. Literally, one guy taking 5 customers orders and the place is just crazy hot without AC. Terrible. Banasree Outlet.",1.0,
"They have the worst food possible. the chicken fry was all raw from inside. It had clotted blood and reddish pink flesh. When asked about this to the waiters, they said it was calcium coming out of bones, not clotted blood. i request everyone not to eat at baba rafi for ur own sake. u may end up with some bad disease for consuming these awful food.",,False
Ordered the kebab and was really surprised by the quantity of beef and other ingredients. i had to eat half the oily bread and then got the taste of the kebab. This is unacceptable from a food chain of this calibre. Serve your food the way it shows on the menu and dont deceive your customers.,2.0,
i tasted the chicken kebab and was really great!,,True

"We had the following (opposite NSU main gate 1 & 2): 1 Beef Burger = 99 Taka. Was pretty good. Loved the buns they use. The patty was good for the price range, despite being doused with a lot of sauce. Also, it is a very messy burger so make sure you get tissues. 2 Chicken Burgers = 198 Taka. The chicken burger is definitely the best item on the menu. Delicious patty which complements the soft sesame buns. They use the same sauces for both the beef and chicken burgers. Howeve...r, the sauce combo tastes much better with the chicken patty. 1 Beef Kebab = 99 Taka. The packaging is nice, the kabab wrap is decent. It is definitely not worth getting this for 99 taka. Also, the beef kebab has star anise in it, so if you don't like the smell of star anise, stay away from it! 1 Chicken Kebab = 99 Taka. Again, the chicken version is much better than the beef version. Still not worth 99 taka IMO. The meat to veggie ratio is waaaay off. They need to put more meat in this to be worth 99 taka. Tastes pretty good though. 1 Mountain Dew = 60 Taka. Regular fountain drink glass (not the tiny ones they give you at KFC or other places). Expensive yes, however it was pretty refreshing. Tasted like proper mountain dew (not some watered down version of it). Recommendations = stick to the chicken burgers. Definitely worth it!",4.0,
"went to Baba rafi 300 feet Bashundhara r/a they only serve 100 and 160 tk combo burger deal! One of the best burger in that price,, but i have to give points to fries,,its similar to Mcdonalds fries and Hungry Jacks i had in Australia. Beef Burger was juicy and the sauce they used was really nice with a hint of Garlic Im gonna be honest, i had most amount of burgers around dhaka from banani, malibag and mirpur, dhanmondi and 300 feet... Baba rafi beats all in price and taste and with excellent cooked fries! Top quality. Thats why i had two burgers!! N.B- every place we been to, customer service is never satisfactory, but this girl in baba rafi,,,she was kind, explainable and also served with smile where she was wearing hijab and with decency,,,5star for because she did that. Thanks for the experience. keep up the good work!",5.0,

Some are sayin they didnt find any meat in it, it was just tomato n onion or even thr service is slower than granny . N some r saying this is the best burger in town, nothing is better than this.

I ordered food using Pathao app. The restaurant calls me and say that price have changed and I have to pay about 250 taka more per items that I ordered. According to them the price did not get updated even though had changed the menu price. I agreed since didn't have much time to order again. Now the rib eye steaks that I ordered cost me 850 each. I received the items on time. The meat was not at all juicy and was so hard that I started to feel fatigue and pain i n my hand to cut. I couldn't finish it neither could my father. The price is excessively high and then you get something like this. I would have walked out if I was served it in the restaurant. The only thing that was good was the mashed potato tasted good.,1.0,

"This place was a bad experience. The food was bad, the cold drinks tasted like it had water in them and the bottles were dirty, there was no electricity the whole time we were there. The electricity thing might have not been totally their fault but if they are running a restaurant business then they need to make arrangement for electricity generators for this kind of situation. U can’t just have one fan. It was suffocating. Horrible place............",1.0,

"Tasty foods, nice environment, good location!",,True
"The food was really good and tasted like I expected, the service was praiseworthy too. But the atmosphere however can get pretty noisy, probably due to the low ceiling and square rooms.

"The foods were really tasty, I should agree. But, the price is way too high compared to their quantity. Quality, Ambience, Service were too good. I didn't like their sea food assorted something, that dish had small crabs mostly which was not at all tasty. Price was 870/- including the VAT, but the amount was so less.",4.0,

If not for anything else I had to come to the page and write a review for the lamb itself..!! I usually never ever try lamb in restaurants but man did this blow me away� U MUST TRY THE LAMB� Overall I liked all the foods and we literally tried everything on the menu� The servers are also very polite and well-mannered.. All in all-the place maybe named 'Little Korea' but it has some big bold bang flavours waiting for u.. Will definitely come again�,5.0,
"Guys I'm sorry but your food tastes like Poorly cooked Indian food, might consider renaming the place to ""Little India"". I threw up after eating at Little Korea last week and I would not recommend anyone to come 5Kms within the place until you get chefs that can make decent food.",,False
"The food is good, service excellent. Salads and starters are tasty. Lambs are juicy but the sea food platter is insufficient. Kimchi was absent, chopsticks and crockeries are poor. Interior has to be improved a lot. The entry steps are risky, please try to reconstruct it properly.",3.0,

"1. Awful service. No one greeted or showed us where to sit. One of the waiters failed to fetch us a bottle of water. 2. The food is at best mediocre for the price. They are charging premium price. The service and the quality of the food should really be up to the mark. I'd be happy to change this review if they manage to improve. When you say ""from the founders of Tokyo Express"", it really is hard to cut them some slack.",1.0,
